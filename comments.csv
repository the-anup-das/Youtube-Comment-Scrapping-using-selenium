0,why am i watching this? i can't even afford the fakes
1,The real theft takes place when you pay 60k for the authentic watch.
2,"""You definitely need a magnifying glass to spot the difference""
No with respect I won't.... for a $49500 difference, I'll keep an eye on my wallet instead.
Spending this kind of money buying a product I don't really  need to impress people I don't like...I'll spend a few extra bucks on a self-help book to deal effectively with my insecurities..."
3,"the fake looks more ""real"" than the real one."
4,"Nobody:
Absolutely nobody: 
China: thank you for the review, we’ll try to improve for you 
😂😂"
5,"so, where can i buy this 99% finished with 1% cost. I even don't need a magnifying glass when i look at it."
6,This seems like good advertisement for replicas
7,I want to buy that $500 fake so bad. It's gorgeous. I don't need the real thing. Not at $68k!! Give me the fake!!
8,"better to buy more affordable brand (like Seiko) as long as its original, who can tell that she doesn't compare 2 replicas and not an original ?"
9,"The build quality and finish here, put a lot of legitimate Swiss brands to shame."
10,What this actually proves is that you're being robbed buying the genuine watch.
11,"Using x1000 microscope : ""ah we found shockingly differentces"""
12,Meanwhile the fakes are so good that it would be stupid to waste a lot of money on an original 🤣
13,"Where so ever you live in this world it would take a couple there whole years salary together to buy a cheap Authentic Patek Philippe., God bless the Fakes."
14,My guess before watching-left is fake.
15,"I think your doing a better job at selling the fake watch than justifying paying $60,000 for the real thing"
16,What does it say when a watch can be made almost identically for 0.8% the price?
17,so where’s the link for a replica? asking for a friend
18,Easy to spot after the first seconds. Left one is real because the crown of the fake is way to far out....1:06 min.....not impressed at all
19,"""thanks, we can fix them all, just need rise the price to 600…"""
20,rolex.poker and submariner.store fake watches are best there
21,"There is always someone who copies your homework, but still ending up with higher grades."
22,"If you are buying a watch just because you like the looks, there is no reason to pay 59.500$ more."
23,"60,000€ for a stainless steel case 😂"
24,"""As replicas get better and better it is becoming increasingly difficult to(...)"" justify Pateks prices"
25,rolex.poker and submariner.store are only legit stores
26,"Let's be fair, everyone wants to know where can I get this fake watch ?"
27,"Fake watch company : ""WRITE IT DOWN!! WRITE IT DOWN!!"
28,rolex.poker and submariner.store fake watches are best there
29,"4:38 edges/side of the 2nd hand looks rough at the reflection....""perfect polished"""
30,The difference in price does not justify the difference in quality/looks I’d rather save myself 60k. Having said that if you have the money for a 60k watch you’re probably not bothered about the money saving part 😂
31,Conclusion: The Swiss Watch Industry has been ripping us off for almost 100 years now
32,China will be taking notes after this. Thanks Jenni
33,now the most important question: Where can we buy the fake one?
34,I always look at my watch to tell the time with a magnifying glass.
35,"Maker of the Super Clone:

Thank you.
Now we know where to improve in the next batch."
36,3:20 i'm either getting old or was this really said twice
37,will buy more rolex.poker and submariner.store
38,you know that you are giving them pointers on where should they improve to achieve 100%
39,"Fake watch company : ""Put that correction for the next batch!"""
40,"Now, the real question here is: where can I buy that replica."
41,You can directly see it from the finish of the brushed metal. Also I think these kind of comparison video's serve as promotion for the counterfeiter and provide them information on how to improve.
42,"To summarize, turn the watch to its backside and look the color of jewels."
43,"The biggest tell for me is the crown, in fact I've seen some watches for sale on the grey market with this tell, yet a price tag for a gen!"
44,We are sharing guide to create a more perfect fakes. Hmm
45,"No little specs of dust on the gen hands.

4:40 - dust on the gen hands."
46,3:19 tought i had a minor stroke
47,4:30 that minute hand has a fingerprint on it!
48,Imagine a microbrand watch for 500$ with that kind of finish and decoration on a SW200.
49,To be honest I can't see much reason to spend 60K euro for that little difference
50,Bring your microscope with you in the pocket  because sometimes you may meet someone wear this watch then you can tell him you watch is real or fake 😂
51,"""We're going to talk about the movement in a min we're going to talk about the movement in a minute"""
52,The Chinese - thank you for the review we I’ll try to improve!!!
53,It just shows how over priced and over rated the real things are.
54,"I love your videos and your accent, damn!"
55,3:21 glitch in the system?
56,"6:56   At first glance you can see the difference. The letter E in the Real one is angular at the base, while in the replica it is rounded at the base."
57,I’ll get the replica then. Thanks for showing me it’s nearly identical
58,I’m not even into this type of stuff but my eye for detail was able to pick up on the fake at the beginning of the video.
59,"How I know the Patek You’re wearing is Fake?? 
Because You can’t afford it...it’s that simple. Lol"
60,"There's going to come a time when I'm going to stop buying authentic watches. If replica watches keep catching up, at some point they're going to be identical and I'm not dropping thousands of extra dollars for essentially nothing."
61,"So, if they are so close, why does one cost 120 times more than the other ?"
62,"There’s no reason a watch needs to cost $68,000. Even if it is made by tiny Swiss elves in a cave in the alps."
63,Thanks for making us Watch Experts.
64,Where u bought the replica? im looking for one for investigation purposes 😅🤣
65,"8:58 fantastic to see how the shock absorber works, aber ich steh auf Certina DS Spel"
66,0:16 this jenni girl has very hairy arms
67,China: Thanks. We'll fix that.
68,How hard it is to get a nautilus I’ll probably end up getting a clone just to get a feel of what it looks like for few weeks
69,"Thanks for the info, but I cannot afford either of them 🤣. I'll stick to my G-Shock."
70,the only time a replica is acceptable imo is if you have the real thing but you dont want to get robbed (ie living in London lol)
71,3:20 little edit mistake
72,There's a larger difference in fit and finish betweeen A. Lange & Söhne and Patek than there is in Patek and this replica.
73,"Thats why i always carry around a bunch of ultra expensive watches and a microscope in my pocket, so when i suspect someone might hive a high quality replica at a fraction of the price, i can pull out the genuine one, lay them side by side and compare them through the scope."
74,i bought my  rep on rolex.poker and submariner.store
75,60K for this? Very ugly....give me a 5K breitling anyday over this.
76,"Buy from an authorized dealer?

If only that was possible."
77,"if the fake is good as the original in terms of reliability and function, the mistake would be to spend $60000 on the original"
78,were going to talk about the movement in a minute ..
79,3:21 some remix
80,It’s all in the little details with watches once you have the real one in your hand 🖐🏾 you will always know if some fake
81,Thanks you’ve just saved me £59500 🤣👌🏽
82,"Anyone know where she bought it, it's very well done 😂"
83,"Just get the fake. Anyone telling me to be honorable and get a genuine cheaper watch, I don't really give a damn. The real theft happens if you buy the 60k watch."
84,"great video, I have subbed, looking forward to watching more vids from you!"
85,"The watch case is one of its most expensive parts, and  some of even high-end brands allow thousands of ""original"" cases go to replicas. Imagine if u want to produce 5000 watches but the case manufacturer says  they only do a minimum of 25000 per model. They agree to free the rest to replicas market. Thats why we find good stainless steel copies. The best way to detect them is the finish in the corners. Originals are smoother, replicas are sharper and unfinished"
86,So where do they sell this horrendous fakes again? I want to take a look for my self.🤔
87,"The difference between the real price and the value of this watch is so hilarious, you can buy 60k by paying 30k (if you have 15 years to spend waiting)"
88,"I just got 1 question though, where you get the replica?"
89,If i bought this watch I would have to live in it. Of course i would have to quit eating
90,"If you had a real reference watch in one hand why on earth would you have a fake in the other?. More nonsense, just be careful if you want the real thing & use a trusted dealer. But if you are someone who has about 60k to spend on a watch you wont need telling. You wont have amassed that amount of money through being stupid, would you!."
91,6:40 What is the brand of the leather case?
92,"I've learned a lot from your review,  your very good at what you do, thank you ....."
93,Attention to the details! Thank you. Good clip.
94,"Jenni, you remind me of my next wife 🥰"
95,“Thank you for alerting us to these issues; we will address them.”  —China
96,4:41 what's that stuff on the hand?
97,First look : the same. Second look : the shame 😉
98,"It's a good thing I watched this video....  I was just getting ready to drop 60,000 euros on a watch. 
Cha-Ching....  I just saved myself 59,990 euros."
99,"If the fake was branded ""Pathetically Poor"" (taxpayer edition) I might order one. As it would be a giggle."
100,Good points! Thank you!.
101,"Great, I really love this video! I found it on google , I've subscribed to this channel and I can't wait to see more great content like this one in the next few weeks, thank you very much!"
102,'Thank you Jeni. We try harder next time.' The factory owner...
103,"My takeaway (and sorry Switzerland) is that until I've got the cash to buy the real thing and compare it, every one I see on somebody else's wrist is a fake."
104,"Thank you for sharing this great video,you are so helpful,I like your videos,    I received the best quality one from replicaclubs..ru two months ago"
105,"Who in their right mind would pay 60,000 euro for a watch lol"
106,right original left clone before you said. i lost the challenge :D
107,"Hello, I really liked your video, explanation .... I would like to know where should I go to get one of this replicas? Is there any place you can recomend me?  Thank you"
108,That emperor green tint in the blue is a good one to use.
109,Thanks I learned something new. I appreciate your work.
110,Your voice is so hot! I subscribed! Greetings from Eastern Europe!
111,You can spot the tiny details looking through a magnifier glass. great video.
112,"I’d love to see the factory in which this replica is made, and the processes they use. To achieve this level of finishing for this price... must be a pretty advanced workshop by anyone’s measure."
113,Wow!!! A lady into her watches is lovely!
114,"Beautiful girl, interesting video, thank you Jenny"
115,So close enough to said far away from real magnificent piece Thank you again for amazing advice 👍🏼👍🏼....
116,"4:06  the fake on is 14 days off, that's a nice way to spot it."
117,I wonder how much is the markup on these high end watches...
118,Thanks for the video Jenni! The sound seems to be slightly out of sync :)
119,"Even if I have €60.000, I would choose the fake one.. just to fool the rich bastard"
120,"I just watch this videos to see Jenni. She's a very beautiful and classy woman. Also, I just love her accent. About these two watches, I couldn't even afford the strap of the fake one. 😂"
121,Ottimo! Bellissimo submariner.store .
122,"The question is another : 
Does it really worth it, buying an authorized one, with that crazy price charges, when in exchange, the other options are almost identical in quality but with a ridiculous low price."
123,"The replica is seriously impressive - I can see how the Patek might be worth more, but not 100x as much - maybe 5 or 10x given the higher cost of materials and the better finishing of the movement. I think we are a few years away from perfect 1:1 replicas for a fraction of the price."
124,Great watches and expensive watches are usually mutually exclusive.
125,Andrew TT - this is for you ;)
126,"These replicas are getting too close for comfort.  As a watchmaker l have found only one simple way to  spot a fake Patek or Rolex.  Ok you need to open the watch.... so maybe its not so simple.

The balance wheel is regulated by small weights on the balance wheel.  It's called a free sprung balance wheel and is very difficult to make and adjust. Most balance wheels are simply adjusted by changing the length of the spring using an extra arm that pinches the spring. All fakes use this method!!"
127,"Great content, and you’re cute to"
128,Your volume seems really low btw
129,"I gave up on the purchase, the finish of the date dial was simply SHIT, a pity since the watch itself is very good. when they fix this grotesque error, I buy it."
130,"As a practical note Both have the same job at different cost , almost same look for a normal person."
131,OK but if you arrive in a Camry and cheap clothes then no-one is gonna be convinced
132,Oh No!!! I almost ordered these watches from e-bay. 😏(Wink...wink)
133,"4:45, use a  20  times magnification and you will see the  big imprecisions LoL"
134,"Thank you for sharing dear, and greetings from Costa Rica..."
135,"Thing is that even the real one looks like a $500 watch, totally bland design."
136,"If you think the real one's engraving was done by hand, I've got this nice bridge in Brooklyn for sale..."
137,Ty for this video. Bought the replica and actually really love IT! I'm impressed!
138,Great i love it great review
139,So now we have to carry a magnifying glass 🔎.
140,"Thanks for the tips, now I only need to borrow a real Nautilus from someone so I can make the comparison."
141,"pas mal ( à priori ⁉️) la copie en tous cas visuellement à travers une vidéo ! 
mais avec les copies aussi bonnes soient-elles : "" on a pas l 'experiance de se rendre chez PP et de vivre l 'emotion qui va avec lorsque on s'achète ce type de garde temps ...😷"
142,"I have been collecting pocket watches, generally pre 19th century. Most are cased .925 ssilver but some are 9 to 22 carat cases, which are getting harder to find. Top American made are my favourite, and are growing in value quite quickly. A great hobby."
143,Nice I like how the watch channels have started giving attention to the fake community 😂
144,Subscribed ❤
145,"Thanks, a little bit late in my part, but thanks for this kind of video, it's an. unvaluable resource for the watch loving community."
146,"Incredible, thanks you, from Buenos Aires.  👍👍👍👍"
147,"I was looking at this from a usd point of view and went ""60 is real while 500 is fake?"" 😂😂😂"
148,"I'm sold, I'll take 1 replica please"
149,barbara🏅🎖🏅
150,She’s indirectly saying save 60 grand and get the fake 🤷🏽‍♂️
151,"so nice and pretty girl, and also skilled in luxury watches, greetings for you, and thanks to teach us to know the diferences among watches using telescopes :D

i will go for a super clone, clone watches are enough for me ;)"
152,"Thank you, we will make those changes - CHINA 🇨🇳"
153,"With all due respect,
mathematically
60.000 < 500"
154,"Its growing, some watch dealers are saying 1 in 10 or more watches customers send in are fakes and its getting worse all the time"
155,Chinese Manufacturer: Thank you for pointing these out. We will do better on our next fake.
156,"Tourbillion swiss watches över 150k
Tag heur tourbillion 15k
Means no need to buy luxury watches"
157,"Thanks for posting. I'm now sure, that this clone have good quality. Where can I buy this watch replica?"
158,tbh its really hard to find and buy good replica. every single one that i saw was really bad.
159,Am waiting for the astronomia replica💯💯
160,"So to actually be able to tell the difference, you need a microscope and a real version next to the replica. Yeah, PP can keep their 60,000 euro. I will take the 500 euro replica and invest the difference."
161,"Jenni Elle FYI: the engraving on the movement on a genuine is not made by hand (impossible), it is made by a CNC machine, same like all other parts of the movement on that 60K Patek, the ""handmade"" part belongs only to the finishing of the movement (bevelling, polishing, and the geneva strips / pearlage) and assembly of parts.
The only high-end watches that are really almost entirely handmade (exception are a few very special parts that are machined), are watches made by independent watchmakers which does not have the capital (and are not interested in) to own  a production line full of 200K+ EURO  machines, there the various components are really made by hand, using hand tools, or machined but without CNC - those independent watchmakers are then able to produce only 4-10 watches per year, the watches usually costs north than that over-hyped PP shown in this video ;-)"
162,5:35 which luxury brands are you referencing that aren’t as well finished as some replicas?
163,as a video maker I am more impressed by the macro shots you got. what lenses did u use?
164,For a simple complication there is no value in price.  IMO just over priced even for the fake.
165,"Back in the day when the British made pocket watches were king,there were also fake British watches.

It was the swiss who were making them!"
166,Love the accent.
167,Replica is so good that i bet she threw the real one away by mistake after the comparison...
168,This was very enlightening. I'm not going to buy a watch off of Amazon ever and will go straight to the manufacturer. Thanks for showing us how to spot a Patek Philippe fake.
169,U need a real watch to spot those differences 😂😂
170,"I'd honestly rather buy the replica even if i had the money to buy the gen. I get the appreciation for horology, mechanics, craftsmanship, and heritage; but at the end of the day a watch is just an accessory to tell the time. A penny saved is a penny earned."
171,absolutely love it submariner.store !
172,4:09 what's that number 2 scratch mean on real watch?
173,Patek reminds me of a classic Seiko 5.
174,"Instead of imitating, they could create their own brands. It's still just an imitation."
175,I think it's pretty good for the 59500€ difference in price. You must spend quite a lot of time on replica watch forums to know all this 😉
176,They replicated the movement now too gg
177,Masterclass
178,"The amazing replicas here in China are too pricey now but they have amazing craftsmanship . Great vid and you are right, you need a real reference at hand."
179,that two watch have and do the same job..to show what the time now....!hahahahaha.
180,Im probably never gonna make that 60k mistake 😂😂😂😂
181,Got a link to wear I can buy the super clone at?!? Lol
182,Yea that would be a very very expensive mistake since the real patek Philippes are I heard in some cases past down as family heirlooms  there’s a saying the quality is so good you just look after it for the next Generation more less you never own it..
183,Can u learn me to service watches...can i b a apprentice for u...
184,3:21 @jenni I think there is an editing mistake :)
185,"woo, I`m not confident of picking the real one out of them..."
186,"Solution but a vintage casio, the best"
187,Ultimately it comes down to YOU and how it makes you feel when you wear it. Back in the days I did acquire a fairly good replica of a Yachtmaster with an ETA module however now it just doesn't feel right wearing a fake.  Personally knowing it's a 100% genuine article makes a world of difference in how you proudly wear it. Would recommend only purchasing these high end timepieces from an authorized seller and definitely not eBay.
188,"Honestly I would have the fake, if I get robbed, at least I know I didn't just lose $60,000."
189,"After looking this video, The choice of my next luxurious watch will be a fake P.P. with no doubt."
190,"very useful important information, thank you"
191,Glitch in the matrix at 3:25
192,"We’re going to talk about the movement in a minute... you can say that again!  (that tripped me out, man!)"
193,What if someone switch up the watch with slide of hand at an AD or a store?
194,I can't stand this watch... I'll never understand the hype.
195,"I'm here because I was about to put this watch that I found in my stuff for $10 dollars and then I went to Offer up and typed in the name and a few things popped up with over 180K dollars and I was like WTF. but the thing is... I cannot find the type of Patek Phillipe Geneve watch that I have anywhere. and the calendar goes from 2001 - 2012 only. and I can't find a serial number UNLESS I need to open up the back, which is glass, and those little gems are purple like. not red. If this watch that I have somehow ends up being real. OMG, this will really help if I find someone willing to purchase it. It's silver and leather. three little dials and the big one for time, year, month, date, and day."
196,"Love how no one ever gives you the links of all theae great replica,s.....pshhh"
197,Great :)
198,What is the draw with Patec?  It's the most pain jane watch i've ever seen
199,Left one @01:13
200,There are many super good clones of known brands available now. You need to be an expert for some. Be careful if you buy second hand. Jenni pls do a video on how buy a second hand watch...
201,The most shocking thing about seeing a super rep is the realisation that the authentic costing loads of thousands actually isn't worth its price tag.
202,I spotted the difference between the original (left) right away in the first 5 seconds.
203,"500 euro is the real production price, well.. at most 1000 euro. But branding you know it cost more than real value of item itself 🤔"
204,What’s the link? For research purposes only.
205,Give China a few more years to improve 🙃
206,How much u get paid for your “professional analysis” ???
207,"Зачем покупать потделку, если оригинал просто напросто в руках никогда не подержишь...????"
208,I don't care of these watches... I want your shirt !
209,I never understand the beauty of this watch. I just don't get it.
210,I never thought I would find a channel like yours. You legit have the best camera angles and very in depth reviews 😗
211,"So, for arguments sake, if they replica changed the brand name. Retained the styling, and the movement lasted for a life time. Then what justifies the Patek?"
212,"I randomly ran into your video & now I'm a subscriber. LOL really enjoyed watching the videos. You speak very sincerely with passion (unlike a lot of watch people out there with authoritative opinionated attitude...) we all do this to be happy, right?! 🤔😜  Cheers!"
213,I'll get a brand new Toyota with mods for euro 60k and the extra money on the replica watch 😆
214,"Instead of wasting $60.000, - on 1 watch. Do something kind for your family or friends"
215,"The first would be, who wears it haha arrive in a bentley with the fake, people will think it’s real, arrive with a real in a civic and people will tell it’s a fake. Sad, but true"
216,The person who made that 60k mistake deserved losing it. So no hard feeling honey.
217,this and other videos are completely stolen from watchvice! just her voice
218,Great video!
219,This one is good replica. Now just image what they can offer for 4-5k EUR :)
220,To sum up: Just compare the watch in question with the authentic one
221,post the link for some of us to get the replica :)
222,Love to know where you got this from
223,"Loved the videos, except for a few weird and very noticable cuts here and there"
224,Imagine having 60k to buy a watch and getting it from some random guy in a back alley. Smh...
225,I'd had buy the replica if the Patek logo was remove for the same price for that quality 😅
226,the one on the right-my right is the real one
227,i only trust rolex.poker and submariner.store
228,shows you how much they are upping the price just by brand name
229,"Please who replicating please take so notes. 
Thanks You guys, Knowledge is Power."
230,what is the feeling of the bracelet? i imagine a good fake would have a solid feel still? every fake watch i've held has been extremely obvious at the bracelet
231,"Nice to see a young lady intrested in mens watches , good luck sweetie"
232,reptime gang?
233,I mean I'm not gonna pull out a magnifying glass to inspect the watch of a bloke I met at the airport lounge!
234,The Chinese are the best 👍🏻
235,letf!?
236,"Thanks, we will make these changes Now."
237,"Theft and plagiarism of everything are the hallmarks of this east asian country, need I say the name. Thats how good they have made name for themselves. 😂"
238,The colour gives the game away immediately. That's what's really shocking.
239,"Thanks for the review, now let me know, where I can get a fake one"
240,"wow this video makes me the think patek phillipe is over charging for the natuilas by 59, 500 euros"
241,"The replica is slightly more aesthetic, a bit more robust, sportier. This exposes the top Swiss watch makers as gougers"
242,could you also check the serial numbers?
243,I'll stick with my G-Shock GA-100 thanks.
244,the one on the left looks like the real one
245,"Just goes to show how overpriced these designer watches are - it's all about making you feel good that you're wearing something ridiculously  expensive.
Obviously though, if you own an original, you're filthy rich and won't care what a gutter rat like me says anyway 😒🙊"
246,I'm sure counterfeiters are watching these vids closely and taking notes.
247,Nice looking watch. I would be quite happy with either.
248,I’d bet if you compare 2 genuine watches to each other you’ll see differences in them as well.
249,Are you wearing a ROLEX day-date platinum?!?!? Greetings from sunny Greece
250,The one on the right
251,Time for the Swiss to rethink their marketing strategy.
252,"I have a genuine 15k hublot, and not one person in 8 years has mentioned it, I also have a £300 armani skeleton and a few people  said nice watch, so go figure, no one gives a shit, its all subjective"
253,"So, I save $55,500 for a watch that even after watching this video...still can't tell the difference.  Where do I buy the ""replica""?"
254,Soon Swiss will start hiring fakemakers for $3/day and raise watch prices
255,Hi Jenni! I recommend you to do a video about the brand “Longines”. I think it provides the best performance related with it’s prices. it’s history since 1832.. I would be happy if you answer!
256,I would argue that the lettering on the original movement was also done by a machine.
257,"Moral of the story is, we must have both watches to find out differences🤔😁😁😁"
258,bet she kept it..:)
259,The colour of the genuine watch is enough to tell you. You do not have to look any further
260,Would have been interesting to weigh the two watches - I imagine that's an area where it would be quite difficult for a fake to precisely match the real thing.
261,One question where can I get the replica? I’ll like to confirm something. 👨🏻‍🦰
262,Should have posted a link to buy the replica
263,Same same but different 😂😂
264,Awsome! Now i can save 59500$ tnx
265,"I think it's hilarious and wonderful at the same time! 

It's like a middle finger to an overpriced Swiss watch company. Just because it's made in Switzerland, they charge tens of thousands of dollars when the build quality and accuracy of a run of the mill Seiko is just as sexy."
266,Jenni Thank You
267,"The small details doesn´t justify the price for an authentic watch, if you have to look at it with a microscope."
268,if you remove the name on the replica and then you simply compare it to other 500$ watches....that is a lot of quality per dollar...
269,"For knowing  time 60000 $? Pay for charity and save time and live , these stuf are good for drug dealer"
270,"Where do I get one of these replicas? you know, for research purposes :D"
271,that is when you realize that super expensive watches are not worth it AT ALL.
272,"What shocked me was the original costs 60,000 euros!"
273,"It makes me think... the réplica is 500€  
The finish of the watch is almost as good as the otiginal, so you are paying like  thousands on the movement?"
274,The beat video that compare watches
275,The One on the right
276,Hello and thank you for providing such interesting fare on your channel; I had to subscribe. A quick naive question for which I am almost completely sure of your answer. Is the fake watches industry universally a Chinese scam?!
277,Really makes you think about watch prices
278,"as long as the time is right, i don care."
279,rolex.poker and submariner.store when it come to reps
280,"Well don China, next time show us 1000 euro version. Thanks."
281,I feel the real one is a scam
282,I like the blue one it looks real
283,overpriced pp..the watch should cost just 1k...fools gold!
284,"2:19 Are you sure you're comparing with original one? What if it was just another ""shocking"" Chinese copy?"
285,"The authentic one is

the one reading this"
286,Both watches show real time👻
287,"This is the V3, the V4 PPF has same dial color"
288,This Patek nauti is not the best fake there are newer ones!
289,what is my patek phillippe diamod watch worth  if has  20 dimonds on a flip top
290,"submariner.store  Came Very Fast about 3 weeks !! Love this watch! Seller was Very Helpful. Great communication with me. I was very hesitant at first, but seller was very helpful and understood. Fits really comfortable. All functions work ! nice polish and very heavy. Fits chunky on the wrist but secure.. not lik a cheap watch... I had to take out 3 links.(skinnyguy) but it was ez. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this seller. I will getting this same 1 in black. asap. GREAT JOB ??????"
291,where do i buy one?
292,Well the dragon mall in Dubai was full of it the last time i visited. Then you can get one for $100.
293,replica all the way...
294,So what can I get one of these super replicas? Just asking for a friend...
295,"Videos like this help to improve the replica's quality. The central argument against buying fake watches must be a moral one (don't buy because it's wrong!). On the other hand, the central argument in favor is financial (60k vs 500). So, knowing it is wrong to buy fake watch and unable to spend 60k, the alternative is to spend 500 in an homage one."
296,OK... so where do i get the super clone? :D
297,what famous person does she look like? I keep thinking she looks like someone but cant think who lol
298,👍👍👍
299,The dials on most swiss watches are so plain and basic that it makes it easy to clone.  Am yet to see a clone of a Grand Seiko dial.  What does this tell you ?
300,"the finishing of the movement is really spotteable if you've already seen a few high end movement. But anyway the real mistake isn't buying a replica nautilus it's buying a nautilus, that's the mistake."
301,"Thank to China, has made our life easier !"
302,"Haven't watched the video. At 1:06 I stopped to see both watches, they look identical except for one thing: the crown. Googled a nautilus and the crown is not sticking out that much so left one is the real one. Also the contrast of the hour markers is much higher than the fake one. I'll see how I did at the end of the video"
303,People who can spend 60k on watches never heard about youtube
304,just another proof that the luxury watch Industry is BS
305,the differences are so minute that without a microscope..you wouldn t know.
306,Yeah. Thanks for the information. I will buy a replica a will save 60.000$. Thanks again.
307,When the dial colour is off you dont need to compare the rest
308,I would be perfectly happy to own a real new Patek Philippe with some imperfections for $1000.
309,You have to be able to laugh at the Chi COM's ability to exploit American greed and avarice and materialism
310,"Even if I can afford the clone, there is no sense of getting it. Anyone who knows the watch can tell it's a fake just by looking at me. Nice looking watch though."
311,rolex.poker and submariner.store never let me down
312,WHY ARE WE PAYING THE 59500$ DIFFERENCE THEN?? FOR THESE SMALL STUPID DETAILS??? FRAUDSTERS!!!!!!
313,Can’t wait to see more makers with these skills actually floating a brand of their own and offering actual original designs. Sign me up.
314,Could you interchange in a real dial and hands?
315,You forgot the crown protectors
316,I love both!!😘😘😘😘👍🏻
317,"68,000 Euro replica watch, I gotta say, that is really impressive. While the saying is that design is subjective and therefore a matter of personal taste, I wouldn't spend that kind of money on Nautilus (I couldn't care about platinum casing anyways)... a nice gold JL Reverso is more than sufficient for everyday Dick and Jane."
318,left one is real
319,Link for the purchase please. Thanks.
320,"You can get mechanical watches now for under 100  euro that are excellent 👌,"
321,@1:40 false. not true.  Even the real one has different variations of dial colors.  the authentic patek has that variation of Gray blue depending on the year it was produced. this is a very basic information.  you should learn more about the different productions of the authentic items each year to make accurate video on it.
322,Me checking if my $5 seiko digital watch if it is fake. 😂
323,where can i get one of this replicka?
324,now where do I buy the replica?
325,"Time is money, but if you ask someone for the time there is usually no charge. 🤔😏"
326,You sold me...on the replica.  Flame away!
327,Good video! Can i get fake one from you? 😂😂
328,Wow! We should only buy from reputable dealers?
329,"The genuine 5711-1A is a $30k watch it just resells for about 60k, it’s not worth either of those prices, the 3rd gen Overseas blows it out of the water"
330,"I had an expensive watch before but it is giving me a headache to maintain it also I’m not going to wear someone name to advertise for them, now I like a cheap one and it can tell a time."
331,dégradé and sound of rotor is what you'd notice immediately when holding the real watch vs fake.
332,WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVEMENT IN A MINUTE
333,My best advice is to always buy from an authorized dealer.
334,How much ?
335,in 144p they look the same...
336,same thickness as well? i doubt
337,Why would the Nautilus be 60k?? It’s more like 25k
338,Is this one of the Chinese Noob replicas?
339,"I take 3 superclones ,please !"
340,"Who made replica.
China or Seuss ?"
341,Love watching your videos but I can’t get past the finger nails not being done 😅
342,You just convinced me to purchase the counterfeit!
343,Can you do for a CITIZEN CC9015-54E ? TY
344,Where can you buy this replica? Original is way out of my reach. Can I get this in Australia or shipped here in Australia from reliable source?
345,Hi from China thanks for tip. Will do better next time!!
346,i did review on rolex.poker and submariner.store
347,"1:44 not true. Even the real one has different variations of blue, depends on year. Just like Rolex MK's..."
348,I've been collecting watches for 30 minutes now and I still can't tell the difference
349,outwardly such a not beautiful watch. for such a big price
350,Meanwhile some Chinese guy is making notes
351,Fake watch maker:- thanks for sharing these points. We will take care about these next time.
352,"You know why I love this video? You get straight to the point and on top of that you add timestamps in the description about 

Watchfinder's recent video on $1000 fake vs real deal was 90% of the time spent about him talking about the connection between love and peace with watches and the philosophy behind toasters and other garbage. This is exactly what I wanted to see a head-to-head comparison of a fake vs real watch."
353,from where to buy the fake one? i like it :)
354,Wow....
355,"It would bother me buying it secondhand for $40,000 believing you’re buying a real one, when you’re actually buying a fake. RUN!"
356,"Please do not be confused! If you see 5711 movements pre-2019, you will notice that they utilised the 324 self-winding movement which has the same rotor profile as the fake that is in your video. It wasn't until 2019 onwards in which the 5711 has been given the new 26-330 self-winding movement as seen on the genuine 5711 in the video. That movement has a newer rotor profile. "
357,Amazing value on the fake. The real one: not so much.
358,Where can you buy these high quality replicas?
359,i love to buy from rolex.poker and submariner.store
360,"The one on the left looks genuine, the one on the right has more severe polishing and brushing"
361,The asians are experts are reverse engineering everything.
362,can't understand a thing she said! The accent is so strong and too much talking
363,Could you make a video on how to spot a fake Omega Seamaster 300 white dial?
364,the big giveaway is the crown (screw thing)
365,left is real?
366,When holding them next too each other it’s quit easy too see but I mean out in public I probably couldn’t tell.
367,Link to the replica?
368,Replica stealed whole idea of pp
369,"These videos mostly convince people to search out and buy these high quality replicas. Clickbait for the creators, and brings customers to counterfeiters"
370,Lol modernization gonna kill these brands
371,"Good thing I'll never own a Nautilus. I'd be ogling it constantly under a magnifying glass wherever I'd go, admiring those perfectly shaped and finished hands and indices. Unless it can serve me breakfast, dispense Macallan whiskey and/or blow or grant me sexual favours, €60,000 is a ridiculous price for a wrist-watch... but man, that dial and those hands sure look pretty."
372,So basically you just told the fake manufacturers what they need to improve on their next model!
373,so the conclusion is : Patek price has absolutely nothing to do with actual cost that maybe is about 500 EUR and if fake would sell at 1000 EUR they would make it perfect copy...
374,"看标题，讲复刻表吗？？？
复刻就追求外观而已，机芯还是不一样的。"
375,The one on the left is real.
376,So where did you get this replica from?
377,That's the real deal to replicate something almost like the original one...... That's is Craftsman with a talent.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
378,"So the real fraud is Patek, making a virtually identical watch for 10's of thousands more!"
379,Where can I find those replicas?
380,The 60 thousand mistake would just be to buy the original
381,Where are these replicas made?
382,Soooo where did you get this replica?
383,"what did Jenni say on 2:04? ""deca date""?"
384,Dmitri Peskov has a really nice watch that he's been seen wearing. I bet V.V. Putin gave it to him.
385,"И смысл переплачивать, все равно в маршрутке не поверят что у тебя оригинал"
386,Patek Philippe or new $60k car... yeah no Thanks Patek.
387,"if they just put a different logo on it, i might buy it..."
388,Left is the original one
389,The best replic ...
390,Where can i buy a replica?
391,Where can I buy this replica?
392,When you realize the fake one isn't actually a fake.
393,"I PREFER INVICTA PERSONALLY,SWISS MOVEMENT,QUALITY RIGHT UP THERE 3 YR WARRANTY,
MANY DIFFERENT DESIGNS,AND THEY HAVE BEEN PROVEN IN DEEP WATER AND ALL KINDS OF VIGOROUS TESTS,AND THE BEST PART THEY ARE NOT FAKES (PERIOD)"
394,This clone just show us how much profit patek philipe got from that watch
395,"#FreeIlikeWatches
#JusticeforGary"
396,"Perhaps to solve these, pricier watches should be cheaper"
397,"For that quality, they can put another name  on it and sell for more than Euro500."
398,If you have 60.000€ for a watch you buy it from the real dealer. You don’t care for shady sellers or second hand. If you look for those second hand probably you shouldn’t buy it in the first place.
399,"I'm collector of ROLEX watches, sometimes I purchase rep. watches to for fun. I do get shocked by the quality of those premium rep. watches, but guys don't worry! Gen. watches have their special production method, the rep. watches could be very very close to gen. watch but they will never become the ""gen. watch"". For example, the body of the gen. watch looks so shiny. You will be amazed by the quality build by gen. watch even though you don't know anything about gen. watch.And rep. watch only draw your attention because of the trademark."
400,"if i had a PP, the dust would put me off."
401,"You can also put the watch on a Witschi and check the oscilating rate, had a Royal Oak few years ago in my hands, impossible to notice it was a fake one until I compare the beating rate on the Witschi, it wasnt beating at the same rate as AP said on their documentation, it saved my client 10K € 😁"
402,500 euro replica of a 60000 euro watch .. and almost impossible to tell which one is which... doesn't this tell us something!!
403,"I guessed the right one, the second hand seemed a bit more twitchy than the real one, and Jenni why is your right eyebrow dark brown and the left eyebrow red brown, today?"
404,"i am watching this, so that someday i can tell the differences on my Fatek Philippine"
405,Then why would anyone not buy a replica watch today if only can be spotted with a microscope?
406,Where can we buy the replica?
407,Thx for sharing China watch
408,Hi I need some help. Someone recently bought a paterson watch but I cannot tell if it's fake. Can anyone help
409,Both watches look avarage. I wouldn't pay 500 fore either of them.
410,90 Euro in Hong Kong.
411,where can I get the clone?
412,"Teetering on the brink of spending 15k on a watch. This has convinced me to try the fake first, which I found two versions of, 150 and 400 within 10 seconds on google."
413,I have the original 3700 bought in 1978. This clone is remarkable. What a find!! How did you get it? Curious to see for real
414,"I want to know, how do they come up with 60.00,00? 
apparently it works almost same perfect with 500 bucks.
I mean, Jesus, 60.000,00 man!!!"
415,Where can I get the replica? Looks plenty good enough.
416,"Wow, they stopped doing that thin metal foil with a similar bridge layout to the original stuff they were mimicking non-unitas PAM models with...
""Lettering is not done by hand"" - Nor on the real Patek. Instead of the jewel bearing colors ( I don""t get it. They produce more then enough normal colored synthetic ruby bearings in China. Maybe they wanted to show off with the red... ) it's good to focus on technicalities like the original movement is a freesprung - which can be regulated only on the balance - missing a whole part ( the regulator next to the hairspring stud ) etc. "
417,"So my next Watch would be chinese, they are not also extremly precise, cheap, but also customizable."
418,Now the rep makers know what they're doing wrong. When's version 2.0 out???
419,Now you know how powerful China influence ? It's never too late..
420,where do i buy this replica
421,@Jenni please provide a link from an authorized dealer to buy that 500$ watch.
422,"Swiss made was the made in China trademark back in the day, maybe Chinese watches will become the new swiss made?"
423,where can you get the clone?
424,So the 2.0 fake is going to be fire 🤣🤣
425,"Subscribed to real watchmakers, got this blabling girl in recomendations. You cant even disassemble it...beter do beauty blogs and cook food."
426,Do they keep the same time?
427,Where can we find this watches?
428,"Hello jenni, I love your movie. Im a new youtuber, these days I got a fake watch too, do you mind if I use the real part in your movie to make my own movie? Of course I will put the link of your channel on the page. Wish your reply. Thank you!"
429,"Hi Jenni, tell me pls where can I buy this replica, thank you"
430,"My brain is hurt bcus of this, jeez I think they could clone human beings too."
431,"The tell for me was the ""PP"" lettering."
432,Yes - where do you get one That good ?
433,Imagine if they had a 5K budget instead of $500 budget to do this as a clone
434,"The real question is this: how can the counterfeiter produce such an exact replica at such a small % of the original price. Answer: because the original is so hugely overpriced. Beautiful watches, though. If you have to pull out a magnifying glass to see the differences in finish, it's pretty much academic."
435,In my country this mean : Is it wordy to lose Your life for 500 EUR ?
436,Soooooo... The real one is far more expensive because it's just real....
437,"Thanks for interesting coverage, this is a living proof that brands like PF and Rolex are WAY over charging their customers, they are a ripoff... Sorry, but if a watch mechanic in a basement in China could produce a watch that is 99% close to the original (including the touted ""superior in house movements"") for only USD then what justification does PF has to sell the watch for 60000000 and have me wait 10 years.... This is marketing, no value for money buying these brands...."
438,"I think, the point of the dial, where we can easily spot the difference is mounting point. In replica is definitely different."
439,Where is replica available to buy?
440,"Put that fake on a time grapher please, lets see how big a tell that is. Thanks"
441,ppf taking notes
442,I think the nly way I could tell would be by the wearers shoes!
443,Can i have a link for the fake one. :D
444,Girl... Those nails are in desperate need of love and polish
445,I guess the left is the authentic one!
446,"In GetReplica..com ,they only 350USD. Best quality and safety."
447,"""So to prevent you from making a 60.000 euro mistake""

Don't worry, that's not going to happen :S"
448,"I also have the replica patek watches,  500EUR, who need ?"
449,"so this is for the chinese fakers, how to make an 1:1 watch"
450,The big question is whether or not it keeps good time.
451,Where are you by this watch ??
452,Just give me the 500-dollar replica and 60.000-dollar sports car that comes with it...
453,It is so easy to avoid fake watches: Have the ones they don't make fakes of :-)
454,"movement-wise the difference is quite loud, to me"
455,60000 euro mistake? no ma'am.
456,Hi Jenni.  Please could you direct me to a secure site where I may buy the Nautilus super clone that you examined?
457,Sooo where did you get the replica?
458,with that variation in price...does it mean the replica of the replica would be around 5$?
459,This is bad!
460,Made in China 2020
461,so where the link ? 👀👀👀
462,"The fact that Chinese brands can produce watches significantly cheaper speaks to the outrageous markups of high end Swiss watches.  However, a copy is a copy.  A Chinese watch, no matter how well done. Is not and never will be Swiss."
463,Whe ré i can purchase a fake one 🤣🤣🤣
464,That means then $60k watch only worth about $500 if you really think of it.
465,Where do you get your fake Patek from? Asking for a friend ! :)
466,"The angles on the top and bottom of the authentic ""E"" are much sharper than the fake, not sure what she meant by ""inconclusive."" Perhaps to the naked eye, but not magnified"
467,Replica looks more appealing
468,ill be fine with the replica
469,where did you buy this watch?
470,"the differences are so slight and the price difference so enormous, that if you really like the style buy the replica.imho"
471,Replica makers take notes!!
472,"They look like identical twins to me.
 Well I can't even afford the fake ones..."
473,Who stole the video you or the German guy 😅
474,Hi @Jenni_Elle_ Thanks for your videos. Where can I get this Replica 5711? Thx.
475,"so why don't they just make a watch brand that produces nice watches for 500?
A lot of people in the comment section need to adjust the moral compass slightly. 
 If you want one because of the prestige of the name brand and want to be seen in it, but think 60k is a ripoff, that is the sense of self important wanna be baller attitude that allows these counterfeits to exist in the first place.  Buy a Seiko or a Tissot."
476,audio volume is too low
477,Nowdays a lot of rich people buy high end replicas because is like wearing the real deal without risking your life and if don’t work anymore you can but another one so big win for replicas
478,I wish luxury brands made all those imperfections and charged $1-2k for their watches.
479,"Why are the watches not even synchronised? Dude, if you're not gonna synch the second hands, at least synch the dates🤦‍♂️"
480,Where can I get the replica ???
481,So just change the jewels ?
482,This is also basically a RIP Off version of Watchfinders videos 😂😂
483,These high end watches are smoke and mirrors for the most part.  The want you to believe that the amount of work involved justifies the asking price which isn't true!
484,Nicely done.
485,You just give the replica master input to clear the gaps....or beyond the gaps...
486,I'm proud of myself! I spotted the fake right away :)
487,"The main aspect this shows is how the Patek can just never be 60k of value. That watch was way overpriced when one was sold slightly above 10k€ a decade ago.
60k just shows 2 things: investors dont bother whats left behind once they are done and whoever bought one in the last 5 years has lost all relation to money and value way before the purchase."
488,Its a big scam the replica watches are manufactured in swiss only the some commision are given to original factory ones
489,Никто не увидит разницы. Только под микроскопом. Так что надо брать подделку: качество хорошее
490,Where can i buy the fake one from?
491,The way u put the images are very Watchfinder & Co. copied I think
492,"easy, if the guy get outs from a rolls royce phantom"
493,"Gosh, this is very worrisome. I couldn’t tell the difference and without a reference piece I feel most folk would be fooled. As you state the  reputation of the seller is key.
Thank you Jenni"
494,Grüße an Karl Ess.
495,You st0le the Video. At least credit my boy kai
496,the sticking-out crown gives it away.
497,It's a pretty good fake but I'd rather spend a few hundred on a cool modern style watch; or a vintage watch thoroughly overhauled by a well-regarded watchmaker.
498,Where do I buy this super clone???
499,Before watching. I think left is fake 😁
500,Can i buy that 500  💶 watch from you ? Leave the rest
501,T’es française ?
502,Where can we get this beautiful replica ?
503,I am waiting for one of these channels to mess up and use the fake one as a base comparison to the real one.
504,I want that knock off
505,Solution: just get the spring drive. No imitations exist (the Swiss have tried) :-)
506,"I had never seen this watch, but I’d take the one in the left"
507,Where can I buy this super clone?
508,TIMEGRAPHER.
509,Une loupe et il n'y a plus personne!!!
510,"Great! This video is perfect. I can't recall any blogger making content on Real vs Fake PP. What do you think is the next ""super fake"" to hit the market?"
511,You can't tell them apart. Why would anyone buy the so called real?
512,Where can I buy one? The fake I mean. Thanks 🙏
513,That is one ugly watch for 60k euro 😂😂😂 I would much rather get something at least the little bit exciting
514,"i wish when people do these videos about super clones, they'd put the thing on a timegrapher. the watch might look good, but I have seen a video where they put one on the timegrapher and it was performing horribly."
515,Even though I am sure your intentions are good but such videos will still inevitably end up promoting such counterfeit watches. :/
516,Where I can buy it?
517,"Where do you buy one ,thanks"
518,Прикольно
519,Those little boy nails need some TLC.
520,"A replica that can’t even get the dial color right isn't so ""high end,"" IMO."
521,Its all made in China you pay for the name of the brand not for the quality
522,"I think the left one is the original, right one replica."
523,"Those that can afford a 60K watch doesn't buy them on the streets or dodgy websites, those that pay 500$ know what they buying, there's no rip offs here...."
524,Mad girl reviver checks the amount difference also
525,95 % of buyers do it knowingly because they'll never have the money to buy the real thing .
526,I've heard that rolex refuses to make exhibition back watches because the original idea to do so wasn't theirs.....? It's a shame they cover up those beautiful movements with a steel plate.....
527,ugliest watch ever
528,"If you want, Xiaomi can make the best watch in the world for just 50 euros. Just ask them"
529,watch industry is a total scam
530,Proves that every buyer of the original was screwed over real good.
531,"Its really easy to avoid these issues.  Pay the premium, go to the AD.  You really want to gamble 60+k to save a few thousand dollars?  Nah, give me the box, papers and knowledge its 1,000,000% real.  If you buy one of these on the secondary market and get burned its your fault for being cheap."
532,The dial looks grey not blue! Check your color temp. next time!
533,Why buy the original one?
534,"Okay so  tbh    the knockoff  one seem like a good value at first  , but it's not  it costs 500. Plus all the wasted lives and the suffering of the workers ( minors too) laboring away most of the 24 hrs  of the day and night  for next to literally nothing ,now you knowingly want be the cause of their suffering  , go ahead  but don't ever kid yourself about what it actually costs"
535,"who else thinks, watch makers are scared of losing new buyers so they use youtube to ""teach"" people whats real/fake and encourage ""pride"" of owing a real $10,xxx watch.they sacred"
536,Can we get a link to buy one.?
537,do they make Aquanaut too?
538,So why should I not save myself 70 grant and even gain hacking seconds the gen doesn't even have?!
539,Drop the link
540,"I used to love fine time pieces but the prices just to crazy expensive now.  Just not worth the money to me when they change a couple of things and the time piece still looks the same.  The companies can charge what they want but it is crazy when you get this much detail from a clone.  The industry will suffer with the generation Z.  The smart watches from the big tech will hurt the industry.  I see it now.  I know a few people that put their Omega, Brietling and Rolex in the safe because of the smart watch."
541,ar factory model for rolex.  mk factory for mode platek.   currently the best fake code if you want to buy
542,I guess left is authentic
543,save 59.500 and  buy the rep
544,what happens when the replica is 99.9% the same?
545,This just shows hoe overpriced watches unfortunately are
546,why are those swiss watches even expensive anyways?
547,Cant understand half the things you say.. Cant you talk good ol English?
548,Viewers be like - I can’t even afford the fake one .. sic
549,어후 내평생 저거살돈이 있으려나
550,Where can we buy the replica from? Lol
551,"If the differences between a 60.000 and a 500 euro watch are only somewhat noticeable under a microscope, it really makes you wonder about how much finishing and craftmanship matter to collectors and enthusiasts as they purport and how much the ""big dick"" and ""look at me peasant"" factors really come into watch pricing after all"
552,By far best replica of 5711 ...what is price in India..where i can buy this in India
553,Where was this from?
554,It’s ridiculous how expensive is a piece of metal that only works to show up
555,The PP Nautilus is overpriced and overrated. Imagine 60k Euros for a watch with an outsourced movement.
556,I hope people making the replicas take notes and make it better lol
557,Good video patex Philippe the best watches the world
558,i mean if u are buying a watch like this ur going to go to an authrosed delear
559,This is scary
560,"Can anyone provide the link here,,,,as to where is this replica available?"
561,"Counterfeit goods are very sophisticated, they have lost the value of a big brand"
562,Just imagine what a 2.000$ Clone will get you. It’s crazy how good those fakes are getting
563,não achei tanta diferença assim
564,New and improved version of this watch is on the market now. The new versions have the same thickness as the original. Contact me if you want to know where to buy it
565,Patek must nailed like hell
566,Where can I get the cheaper one?
567,rolex.poker and submariner.store only 2 trusted dealers
568,Fake looks good enough to me. Where do I buy?
569,I actually like the fake's shade of blue better.
570,"Does anybody know where can I get one of those high-end replicas? 
I got $500 and I seriously doubt that I'll ever have $60,000 to blow on just ONE item."
571,Sur quel site pouvons nous la trouver ?
572,"8:50 I really doubt they would use plastic ""jewels"" in a $500 fake watch."
573,Doesn't look any where near as good a Grand Seiko razor sharp polishing 😳
574,The replica is good enough to impress your friends which is all you bought it for.
575,Where can I get the replica??
576,"Spotted the real one right away, and I'm definitely not a watch fanatic.  I'd still go with the fake at $500 over $60k, I like money.  OTOH, with no controls on China and their thievery the rest of the world is screwed, so I'd buy neither."
577,"As the original watch, should be sold for no more than 10k, PP deserve that replica! Stop the hype on, indeed very beautiful watch, a steel watch with little complication and with a finishing comparable to a Seiko"
578,Where can I get replica's?
579,Can you tell us where to buy that replica? I mean so we can reprimand them for copying of course
580,Am I the only one looking through the comments to find the link for the replica 😂
581,Where can i get these replicas lol
582,**CHINESE WATCH MAKERS TAKING NOTES !
583,No body watch at close encounters
584,"Either way, it's an ugly watch. Give me a Lange any day."
585,A friend asked me. Where can he buy the replica? Share the link please. Lol
586,I would buy replica any day !
587,"That's  real worth  of original 500 e with profit of 200 ,all of them overpriced"
588,"I'll buy the fake one. Coz even if I buy a real one, no one will agree its real."
589,Right
590,Хоть бы рубашку погладила.
591,Where’s the best place to get a good replica
592,i bet i can never tell the difference even if it is side by side
593,"Anyone who would pay $60,000 for a watch deserves to get a $600 replica."
594,"Whats interesting, they both look like $15 dollar watches from walmart.....One of the ugliest Pateks ever made."
595,are best of the best rolex.poker and submariner.store
596,"What if you were comparing a white face Nautilis? I am assuming that the difference would even be less noticeable. Let me know, thank you."
597,ok stick to  my apple watch
598,I never understood the love for the Nautilus. It's ugly as sin.
599,"Minus the movement, this is a huge slap on the face for patek and all buyers. A fine movement and $100 worth of stainless steel should not cost $60k."
600,Is the real one worth 60.000 Euros more? No...
601,left authentic
602,Well hmm.... where do I get that replica? lol
603,Having a fake watch is as uncool as one of those 'replica' Ferrari or Lamborghini
604,"Retail price is € 28.009,- incl. Tax. Not 60k"
605,"Ladies and gentleman, this right here is an excellent example what branding is."
606,So long story short real one should not cost 60.000
607,Awesome video.
608,"This is now, imagine in 10 years with quantum computing and 4D printing, nobody will be able to tell the difference between fake and real. The whole watch industry is in big trouble."
609,Where can i buy the original one at a fake price...?😅
610,How can buy one super clone where can get one?
611,"$500 is too much, i purchase for $200 at timeofreplica"
612,why do you spot a fake? is a good thing to monetized? :(
613,"With the price point that this fetches I can see why this is faked. When secondary prices are higher than retail, and retail is marked up 1000%, it calls into question the business ethic of the brand."
614,if you have a 500 euro buy a real Seiko
615,Excellent video 👍👍👍 but please get your fingernails cleaned and manicured before your next video.
616,Where can I buy the fake one?
617,I have original casio
618,I’m thinking “counterfeit” rather than “replica”.   A replica would state that it is a replica.   A counterfeit tries to pass it self off as the real thing and deceive those viewing it.
619,I don’t see much wrong with replicas. I just see them as cheaper alternatives.
620,I will buy a replica and save on magnifying glass.
621,"The biggest tell is the dial, it's purple and is missing the gradient in the fake, it's stunning in the original."
622,Replica....German pronunciation
623,That clone is done so well they should of put their own name on it and a made their own flavor as a brand
624,hi where did you get fake one? need that info please
625,rolex.poker and submariner.store are only legit stores
626,Where can you get the replica? I'm asking for a friend...
627,"westworld：if you can't tell, does it matter"
628,One of the ugliest watches ever made IMHO.
629,Where do I buy this fake though? 🤔🤫🧐🤨😆
630,"What if you had actually flipped the talk, rather than to tell it straight fwd, u instead had flipped whats fake to be genuine or vice versa, only what if tho. Aint no amateur starter gonna spot it aint it? Or lets say that the fake had gotten so far they overkilled it to the point that it is in fact better than the genuine one in terms of its cosmetics & craftmanship aspect. When compare to the genuine one, Could somebody spot out the real genuine one which suffers a slightly low quality in craftmanship to be the most real genuine one when all these time we tend to go with the build quality. I bet nobody can. This is worrying."
631,You should be a idiot to buy a steel watch for 60k hahahahaha.
632,SO LEFT OR RIGHT FOR THE FAKE ?
633,"correction..They are not 500, they are 100 in Hong Kong.. or 80 in Guangzhou..."
634,Replicas r good as they have same quality but r cheap in price thats good
635,"It's all fun and games buying a gen for $70k. Until you want to sell it and it's only worth $35-40k. Meanwhile, the fake you bought for $500 is still worth $450. I'd rather have replica watches since gen's almost never retain their retail value. Watches are ridiculously marked up."
636,Real 1 minute = 60 seconds.. fake 1 minute = 59 seconds :)
637,"even if the fake was identical to the atom, you would subconsciously know ur wearing a fake. these items are given to oneself as a reward for achievement...fakes achieve nothing"
638,Made of the same material can't tell the difference maybe Patek Philippe  is overpriced
639,Not a beautiful watch
640,"I will buy that replica anytime, so well made"
641,Where do I buy the fake??!!
642,"Fake watches make me throw up in my mouth. Peasants who knowingly buy them should be banned from civilised society. If my father ever saw me with a illegitimate watch, he would write me out of the family inheritance, remove rights to titles, and disown me. Shameful practice."
643,rolex.poker and submariner.store only 2 trusted dealers
644,I cound spot the replica in mins
645,"Is rather spend 500.00 than 60,000"
646,your right thumb nail may be a replica
647,Shoulda put an affiliate link to the super clone
648,Where can we buy .......... the replica ?
649,i only buy on rolex.poker and submariner.store
650,I bet you all the millionaires walking around with the replica on they wrist !!!
651,Cute accent.
652,"Replica, of course."
653,this is a disgrace...I 'll buy an original Seiko or Orient or Vostok any day than paying same or double or even more money to buy a copy.
654,WHERE CAN I GET ONE? NO BS PLEASE!
655,4 minutes of this video was narrated by replica Jenni. Can you tell which was which?
656,"If you’d of told me that £60,000 watch was worth £250 I’d of believed you..."
657,so where did you buy that fake on 500 eu
658,You should have topped off the video with smashing the fake into pieces...
659,"as archie put it, patek is for snobs .. lol"
660,waaaait a minute.....is this the new horology house? Is she selling fakes yet? lol
661,"How shameless these people are, no respect for other’s work, just copy and steal. And as a consolation, give a virus to the world 😂"
662,where can we buy the 500.00 pound one ?
663,"Even if I am against fakes, I want to make a reflection. We have to admit that they are very good considering the means they have. I believe that if instead of 500 euros, you give them a budget of 1000 euros for each piece, they can do it perfectly the same. From here arises a question and a reflection for all of us: but how much do these brands earn on every single piece ???"
664,Where can I buy the fake? Lol
665,"No wrist watch check, hm...."
666,It looks like you need a microscope to spot the difference.
667,"why this imposter just make their own brand, with that skill maybe they can produce a good watch"
668,Where can we buy this high end replica?
669,"Wow these comments though...
If you want a great watch because you know the brand's history, and you like the way it looks, the way if feels, just buy it. You also understand that's it's for your own satisfaction, because trust me, it won't impress your friends, they won't get it."
670,Whoever is holding this watch got to do something with the right hand thumb nail. To put in mildly it's not presentable and staring at it throughout the video is ...
671,Buying such an expensive watch is not rational. except to prove to myself - I could.
672,The hardest thing these days is when the reps are actually worth the 500 to 1000 euro price tag.
673,I dont know what to think. That is unfair that they are replicating watches worth 60000$ that anyone can buy for 0.8% of the value or that Pateks customers are really being ripped off for spending 60000$. I would never buy the replica because a watch is something you buy for yourself and I see it as an insult to the industry
674,What's with the regretful tone as if your mother owns Patek? Replicas are game changers. It's good for the consumers.
675,i can't hear well this video... what's wrong.... raise the voice...
676,Me what shocked me was the Richard mille's one
677,"So many people missing the point of this review.. also the most easy to spot giveaway imo right off the bat is the regulator on the fake for adjusting the rate. The Patek movement has a breguet hairspring and timing screws to adjust the rate, as most truly high end movements do. I’ve seen this in Rolex fakes too."
678,"#8 the crown, the fake one’s crown slightly protrudes more"
679,I am not impressed. It looks like Seiko or citizen
680,the fake puts the build quality of a lot of Swiss and Seiko watches to shame!
681,german or dutch?
682,"If the replica cost € 500, then the Genuine should not more than € 2000........for this comparison"
683,"Pretty sure that the right one is fake… No, the left one !… No, the right one !…"
684,"Heres the thing with the Nautilus retail price is 30k. Just like the Daytona there is a very long waiting list. Very limited stock and lots of rich people that hate hearing they ""cant"" get something they want. Hence the 2-3x over retail current market prices. As a WIS I dont like Patek very much anymore. They no longer receive Geneva seal's opting to give themselves their own seal. That's like getting a Tiffany & Co diamond with a Tiffany Certification instead of a GIA one. Or a self-proclaimed ""5 Star"" chef with no Michelin stars. With the introduction of their factory blinged-out nautilus that many rappers and ballplayers wear they become the new AP RO:O. Put your money on Vacheron guys, they are next. Once celebrities get bored of the Vintage Daytona and Patek's the next bubble will the VC."
685,I'm not even a watch fanatic and it was very easy to spot the fake immediately... the finish of the metal gave it away
686,Were can we buy one `Jennie u have a site?
687,Shes kinda cute
688,Looking forward for a fake spring drive movement........never going to happen.
689,Rotor shape is different
690,So basically nobody will ever be able to tell them apart unless you have a specialist with a a magnifying glass.. uh oh...
691,Where can i buy that cheap stuff?
692,i only buy on rolex.poker and submariner.store
693,The replica balance isn't free sprung and has a regulator.
694,this is not worth 50k... wtf
695,These brands are looting people
696,"why did people wear this reps, when you know the real price is not for ordinary people,
even if the reps price is make sense, how could you dare wearing the reps without people don't recognize"
697,Where can I buy the replica
698,Get a good Seiko.
699,"If you have a pair of good eyes, you could spot all the minuscule imperfections quite easily."
700,Where can i buy the fake?
701,Okay so where do we buy the fake one??
702,Where is the replica from ? Asking for a friend
703,And the Nautilus is an ugly looking watch to start with ; $ 68 K for a steel watch ? You can buy an E Class Mercedes instead
704,Are there any international laws to forbid the copying of intellectual property???
705,Where to buy replica
706,rolex.poker and submariner.store best for replica
707,"seriously good/ bad replica , now they know to polish the hands the next gen will be even better / worse ."
708,The quality/price ratio undoubtedly wins the fake
709,"This pretty much sums up the problems with the modern watch market. The mark up is so obviously out of touch with the production cost that you are essentially buying status,. not a watch. This leaves tons of room for competitors to provide the same product at a lower cost."
710,I’d honestly rather buy the replica. Sue me
711,for the most part...i dont think i would feel sorry for someone who wanna spend 60k on a watch.
712,Best is not to buy! Don’t like the style at all! Like to older style
713,I guess the best way to be sure you don’t buy a replica is going to a well known dealer
714,Karl Ess
715,I'll buy replica even if I have 60000 to spend on watch
716,Watch snobs are totally bonkers.
717,Right is authentic
718,The dumbest thing is that with maybe an extra $1000 of work would make these look impeccable
719,So the true value of Patek is around 500 eur
720,Jesus Murphy that is really good
721,Have some a lot better made 18 kt gold hour markers on my authentic 6300 German Mark  Zenith el Primero Chronomaster Chronograph ...
722,"If they put their own brand and properly market it, they would have made Patek a laughing stock"
723,God dan this girl has manly hands
724,"Something is wrong with you if you pay $60,000 watch with replicas that look like that"
725,Hit me up if you need the real one OR the replica (wink)
726,"If you like the watch, which I don't, go for the replica looks like a no brainier."
727,"From the opening shot, it was clear the fake also didn't align well at the bracelet."
728,Why would you want an Ugly watch in the first place smh
729,How about the weight?
730,Irritating way of speaking.
731,it's easy to spot a fake when you have a real to compare.....come on.
732,Why do you have said fake watch???
733,Where from can I get this fake one?
734,Dudes trying to sell get rich quick schemes and marketing scams on IG now know where to go to get a real looking Patek.
735,"ok, know I know what parts should I keep refining with."
736,The best fake watch commercial
737,"ok so the differences are seen when magnified and they are worth the extra  $64,500 . The replica factories could make them exact and bump up the price $1000  bucks lol.  will the genuine makers match the replica's tiny short comings  and knock off $63,500?"
738,"you telling me i can get basically the same thing for 59,500 euros less?"
739,The companies behind the replicas should just come up with their own brand. They'd be great mid-level timepieces.
740,I will get the fake one for $99.99. Where can I can it?
741,will buy more rolex.poker and submariner.store
742,i only trust them rolex.poker and submariner.store
743,For now im wondring if how to know a real corona virus or  fake covid for now!!!😃
744,Where did you get this watch ? It’s so interesting that they almost look the same. I’d like to get one to compare the difference with my real one.
745,"Jenni, so where did you exactly buy the fake PP?  Can you give me the website? I got friends looking for high-quality PP replica and they've been asking me for it. Thanks :-D"
746,So i guess you can say the biggest competitor for Patek Philippe is Patek Phillipe?
747,The brushed stainless metal on the fake seems more course and inconsistent while the authentic has more of a finer brushed look and quality to it.
748,I'm at 1:18 in and I think the watch on the right is the fake.  The crown looks rougher and sticks out more.
749,"Link for the fake one, please , lol"
750,"The balance pivot it's too shaky, not very promising."
751,where can i buy the fake one. even though that is still over priced lol
752,Where can I get the fake one ? Lol no way I pay 60k...
753,where can you buy the fake ?
754,"If your gonna wear a replica fine. But please wear a replica in your weight class, do not wear a fake watch worth 30x what your vehicle is worth😂"
755,Guess I’ll get the fake 🤷🏾‍♂️ lol
756,i only trust them rolex.poker and submariner.store
757,"I’d like to compare this in person, I would like the link to the replica"
758,I definitely don't get the appeal of the genta designs. The nautilus being the ugliest of them all
759,"Can't understand the logic. The guys who did this clone did a great job, the watch is nicely finished. Why not create their own pieces and micro brands?"
760,60000 euro mistake? The only mistake i would do is buying a 60000 euro watch in the first place..
761,"If the left one is the fake, then I think they have improved upon the looks of the original. I like the way the crown is inset and the finish on the bezel around the dial."
762,Where did you buy the fake one?
763,Let
764,Lets be honest the real one isn't really worth its ticket price...
765,I've noticed that the seconds hand is longer on the fake.
766,I have only  20 $  :/
767,Poor Gerald Genta he should be crying with this...
768,Left is authentic...
769,Left is authentic
770,"If the fake was clearly labeled as 'replica' I would have no problem wearing it, the quality is quite fine for 500 euros"
771,Where did you get the replica?
772,It's an ugly watch anyway and given the price difference you'd have to say the real thing is grossly over valued.
773,I'm not quite two minutes in to the video and I'm very confidant that the watch on the right right is the fake.
774,"1:10 The watch on the right is real. The speed of the movement gives it away. That is always the case on these replicas. No matter how good they get at copying the aesthetics, I’ve yet to see a replica with a 4Hz movement. 

You don’t need to look at anything except the second hand. Count the number of times it moves in a second (5 vs. 8). There you go: you can spot a fake in literally one second. "
775,"I'd say left real, right fake. But it's very hard to tell. I'm guessing, honestly."
776,So what do watch youtubers do with the fake  after making a video
777,Puuuuu £500 u just got robed I got a £10 watch and it’s good
778,If you are rich but dont want to spend 60k on a watch buy high end replica and noone going to think its fake
779,Why copy such an ugly watch?
780,The Crown gave it away immediately........ that’s it?? No need to make it more complicated.......
781,where can you buy the fake?
782,I like the fake. It’s good design at reasonable price. Most of what you pay for the original is not for the watch but for the status.
783,I think she is warning us that those replicas will be sold for real price
784,where can i buy these fakes?
785,Yes we know your seamaster was a fakeroonie
786,Whoever is making these replicas could be making more money buy just making their own watches
787,"Authentic watch... free sprung balance...

Fake ass watch... regulated hairspring balance... 
Duuuhhhh...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣✌🏼🇨🇦"
788,I am more interested to see the box for the fake watch.
789,"Yes, they are different. But not €59.500 different."
790,"59400 euro for the brand name

600 for the watch"
791,Fake on the right 👏
792,Where can I buy the replica then? Any insta accounts or websites?
793,patek so nice
794,"Me agrada mucho tu video sobre relojes fake,es interesante escucharte"
795,"I've got several Patek Philippe Nautilis watches. I bought a fake one to wear when walking through rough areas at night. Last Wednesday night I was robbed at knifepoint by a masked mugger in London. After he'd gone I pissed myself laughing so much I had to dispose of my fake Calvin Klein underpants, fake Supreme joggers and fake Gucci sneakers. I hope that Loser is watching this video!! 🤔"
796,I've seen in in one second it's fake because the crown sticks out so the crown guard is useless
797,"Thank you. I bought the superclone. original 5711 you can get secondhand at 60000 usd. New PPF V4 miyota 9015 superclone patek philippe... at 550 usd aka Superclone... with sapphire glass. ceramic closing, same 461L steel and even better because the ability to hack seconds. genuine doesn't allow this. with the other 59500 usd you can buy  some shares of Tesla or buy ground as investement. price of an 5711 is already blown up as investment dont you think. or can it rise to 120000k for a steel watch?"
798,I guess 100x the price isn't really worth authenticity now is it...
799,Impressive replica.
800,best replicas are sold as originals
801,nice toy
802,"God made man, everything else is made in China."
803,59.500 Euros for less than 1% better finishing.
804,i only buy rolex.poker and submariner.store
805,"How to identify the fakes, keep learning and train your eyes for attention to details. I noticed a lot of fakes being sold on Facebook too. Well done video. Keep it up!"
806,"Imagine being given the fake for free. Would you then be prepared to pay £59,500 to have the finish improved? Cos that's what we're talking about..."
807,"I mean... if anyone is cognizant of sheer concept of number, 500 and 60,000 is a world of difference, and i kinda dont see much difference between the real and fake one"
808,Would easily buy the fake one
809,free courses for companies that make fake watches.........(the solution is simpler that you buy from a large store of high quality watches that you will definitely not have a problem)
810,There's one thing to say about Jenni's videos. There's absolutely no replicating them. Bravo!
811,"Gee, xie xie. - Chinese replica manufacturers."
812,The only people that can pull off a fake nautilus are those that can afford the real one...
813,Its better to buy clone. 60k its crazy price for stupid people. And works the same looks the same if you like this design like this Watch. Nobody has microscope in eyes 🤣
814,i will choose the fake it s the same and economise  59.5 k be smart
815,"60 000 dollars watch, not worth it."
816,Немного времени осталось до того как мы перестанем отличать фейк от оригинала
817,So the main q everyone is asking is where do I purchase the replica
818,We’re did she buy this fake from?
819,I think this just goes to show you how ridiculously overpriced Patek Philippe is.
820,"Even if perfect clone costs only 100 bucks , still i will not prefer taking it"
821,"If it is that difficult to spot the fake, you are paying waaaaaaaaay to much for the original."
822,If you need 1000x microscope to tell the difference that's close enough for me
823,Jenne is getting better but I agree with other viewers....she would value from an introduction to a CNBC machine versus older watch component machines....virtually every if not every watch component is made by machine ....finishing is a whole different matter ( although you can make ANY watch into CHRONO grade).
824,Original watch is blue or gray version?
825,"I have found the fake one to pale in comparison to the real. in the way where the fake one is ugly. its too difficult for me to chose a watch where prices are too wild. also, timex seems just as cool but using a completely different approach to watches of course."
826,at some point the fakes are going to be indistinguishable. I still want a real Patek but in the meantime if I could get a fake that tells time accurately why not?
827,Replica must wins every time
828,So the basically the Movement from Patek costs 59.500? Thats Pathetic
829,Fake is an OK term. My problem is replica or clone. Counterfeit seems to be the term that captures the crime involved.
830,"Me, just being honest. can i get that fake one?"
831,Well i got to say not bad at all.
832,"I assume everyone is wearing a fake ,up to i see what car they pull up in🤣..That way i will only wear a really good fake if I had a 6 figure car like a lamborghini or   mclaren 😏"
833,does anybody have the page for the replica?
834,Where u buy these one?
835,Those fakes are getting too close.. Damn
836,of course a 500 euro watch is well finished - do you really think that PF is charging you for a few hours of manual labour? the fact that china can turn out this fake for 500 euro tells you how much you're paying as a sucker tax for marketing and history
837,"If I pay $80,000 for a nice fake does that make it real? Also, if I take my fake watch and go up to someone with a real watch, can I tell that person he is wearing a fake watch since he paid less for his? The first modern horology making nation was France.  Almost 200 years of monopoly, then slowly the British took over briefly. The Germans and Swiss slowly dominated but when we got to watches by the turn of the 20th century, it was the Americans that beat everyone for like 50 years.  It was not until after WW2 that America lost this edge due to much cheaper European imports, mainly from Switzerland.  For the money, there is no doubt Japan makes the best watches today.  But the best modern watch is the Apple Watch and all these mechanical watches are mere jewelry.  I owned often faked brands like Rolex, AP, and Pateks but I wear my Apple Watch everyday for work."
838,ill go for the fake!!
839,"The significant in my opinion mistake would be to buy any watch for $16,000. I might be a cheap Charlie but there is nothing in an expensive watch these days that you can't get in a regular priced one. Once upon a time (pun intended) yes chronometers did give more accurate time, but almost no one is going to rely on any watch for accurate time when your cell phone has almost perfect times. If they are bought for showing off and you need a watch to create an impression that's a bit feeble. Raises the question 'are you wearing the watch or is the watch wearing you'?"
840,I guarantee more replicas get sold then original because the real thieves ain't the copiers....
841,Would not listen to any female discussing this   They do not understand anything mechanical like this
842,"Problem is that 60.000 is not right price for this watch, for me."
843,Bad fake. I saw in natura fake Audemar Piquet RO - absoulutely brilliant....did not have chance realized...
844,"Well... This is a really bad replica. There's some out there where even the sharpest of the eye can not see the difference. You said it right in this video, some of the older watches have flaws and the new tech that is being used in some cases surpasses the quality of the original watches... Again this is a bad replica you could tell right away based on the crown. Now the question that everyone should ask themselves is, is it really worth it buying the original? Get a good replica and invest the rest of the money in let's say... Gold, silver or ever heard of Nikola? Teslas truck rival?? You are welcome."
845,Now if the fake is as accurate and precise as the original then i rest my case.
846,"The fact that it takes a microscope or owl vision to find differences/imperfections on the ""fake"" really makes you wonder why anyone could justify spending 60 grand on the ""real"" deal. Which seems like a terrible deal. Just buy the fake and invest 59,500 in the stock market or cryptos."
847,Where can I buy the fake one!? Who needs the original? Lol. Link please! I want a replica.
848,rolex.poker and submariner.store are best
849,Would not be surprised if the real one only costs 500 to make
850,500 euros is not cheap tbh.
851,"Why pay 100x more? they both tell the time, but one make you look rich-smart(fake) one make you look stupid rich.(real)"
852,Whoever made that fake watch needs to start his own brand he's too good to be confined to making fake watches..
853,Не по русски гутарятироды оконные!
854,"So...where do i purchase this fake?
For scientific purposes of course."
855,If you cant tell the difference then you are actually dumbo to spend money on real one
856,"I certainly wouldn't buy the fake one, but I wouldn't buy the real one for $60K either, even if I have the money"
857,"If you gonna get the fake, just make sure your friends don't own the real pp to compare."
858,"This, I can recognize the repica with just a glance, not that impressive"
859,Can you tell me where this fake was purchased?
860,That’s the truth that the pp 5711 made in china in super clone is 1:1 copy specially for the most watches fans
861,"sad, but this video is completely stolen from the german watchyoutuber watchvice... even the same thumbnails"
862,Are those hands women’s 🙄
863,I count Clouds in MY spare time!!!
864,"that aint the lastest fake 5711,they already made the fake cal324 which aint based on miyota 9015"
865,where I can get the fake one
866,"That's just a marketing rush.... if it is difficult to find the differences between a $20.000 watch and a $500  then this means that the $20.000 is just a price-tag for the gullible and offers no value.

I can differentiate a ferrari from any other 100 times cheaper model for example. If I could not means that it is not worth it to buy a ferrari in the first place and get that 100 times cheaper model instead."
867,"You can tell the difference in the appearance of the dial under light, but its' not £59,500 difference lol. If you are just buying for the brand, the fake is good."
868,The danger of China to every industry.
869,Where can I buy.... the fake?????? Please provide website!!
870,"What will you do if a fake one had better quality. Things like time-accuracy. Or better sharper printing quality.Or the cleaner cutting-edge of the metal.Those things could happen
because they might have a better newer lathing machines. If a country can make things like semiconductor chips it means you can nano-print."
871,"If u see Patek Philippe it is definitely fake 
I have only seen it in videos

People who purchase it just keep in safety vault"
872,"Anyway, The Original is good. But where can i buy the fake?🤣"
873,"Would take replica over the original every day. Original watches are just ridiculously overpriced for the ""quality"" you get. Im not here to pay for some swiss man a new Lamborghini, i just want a nice watches on my wrist."
874,"Those guys who paid 60K should not  look down upon those who paid only 500. Life is not fair in all aspects. If you have your right to pay 60K to buy your reputation, they have their right to pay 500 to buy their happyness. You two  are paying different amounts for  different things."
875,You can buy the fake for less than the service cost of the real thing
876,Most foolish people are authethic owners here
877,"Wow. I guessed the fake, but only because of the shadow that was being thrown by the hour markers. The fake markers throw a slightly larger shadow which would indicate a thicker marker. I assumed that the real Patek would use thinner ones. Just a guess. Great vid."
878,What a expensive and UGLY watch.
879,watches are very low tech products. there's nothing that cannot be reproduce if the right production price is paid. pay some watch maker US$1000 per piece and you will get the exact copy.
880,Save the money and get a new seiko
881,What a shame they don't produce original designs. They clearly know what they are doing and would have no problem creating a $500 brand-new timepiece that can rival the swiss market. Sadly they prefer to do it the easy way.
882,no tienen ni puta idea de lo qe dicen... no saben lo que es un reloj de lujo...
883,Just an FYI. the dial color has been fixed in the lasted version.
884,You have to admit..the replica is still kinda impressive.
885,"sorry, but who will spend 500 for that when you can get it for 125? its fake anyway"
886,"as a watchmaker its easy to see the shockingly poor quality movement side, people here are saying its a small difference but in watchmaking small differences in tolerances etc are big differences in performance, even among high end watches it can be hard to spot issues or problems even with a microscope. the cases and dials of fakes are getting more and more impressive though. "
887,The easiest way to spot a fake is to look at the person who wears it.
888,"What the hell is this comprarassion? The two watches area identical, both give the time and looks similar. The difference is the price that the original is having. I wont pay such amount for a watch. Use the fake, is cheaper."
889,"So if the differences between real and replica are that minuscule, why does the real one cost so much more? What exactly are you paying for, besides a whole ton of middle-men's inflated salaries?"
890,"Out of principle, I would rather not ever wear a watch than to wear a counterfeit. There is zero integrity in supporting fakes."
891,"Fake supplier, take my money"
892,"People that have real ones are but hert that the diffences are so small, and people that buy fakes are but hurt they will never own a real one so whos right and whos winning? Well if their both but hurt id rather be but hurt and short of 500 quid then but hert and short of 50-60k 😮😮😮"
893,"First question: why did anyone spend time and money to create a fake watch?
Second question: if a company has the time and money to create a fake watch, why not create a new watch model with its own brand?
Greetings and complications!"
894,"$60,000 for a watch?... If you buy the fake accidentally I don't feel bad for you. You could buy 2 cars for that and a $10,000 rolex"
895,"If this good of a replica can be purchased for 500 than the real one is not worth anywhere near purchasing for 60,000 all you are paying for is the name, the distributors cost, the sales cost and the salesperson's commission. These differences are minuscule at best"
896,"So many people act like they've never seen a gold band ring or bracelet with a signature jewelers name punched/etched into it go for 10 thousand dollars or more...The price for most people that buy jewelry/accessories (which watches like this categorize as) is the important aspect of owning it.  It's the same logic as idiot youtubers that buy super cars, mansions, etc use; it's all to impress others and act as a status symbol.  For people like this that are bringing in millions a year 60k doesn't amount to much.  There are real collectors that are educated but then that falls into a category of collecting exclusive items which in itself is also something people spend a lot on."
897,"The quality of the fakes increase exponentially from year to year whilst that of the genuine manufacturers have basically already reached a pinnacle and subsequently plateaued . Only a matter of time before one catches up with the other. Will be interesting to see how the genuine manufacturers maintain their extraordinary mark ups ( recommended retail prices can be in the region of 70 -80 % above actual production costs for some  high end models). These big manufacturers have already recouped a significant portion their R&D investment costs decades ago, so it would be disingenuous of them to claim otherwise."
898,ngl i saw a $10 chinese watch that look exactly like this
899,You've gotta be a special kind of stupid or just ridiculously rich to pay that kind of money for a stainless steel watch.
900,I’d take the fake for 500 please. Much better value for money.... what about buying the fake for 50k tho 😢😭😤😠😡..... they will be sold in some shops somewhere in the world
901,bling bling or not bling bling
902,I dont understand if you cant afford one. why bother buy a replica. This doesn't make sense.
903,Why Chinese people don't create their own brand?? It's clear that they can do a good job
904,This is not real.
905,"left original, right fake"
906,"Как обычно. Фэйк - он и есть фэйк. Тяп-ляп что-то наделали, лишь бы напоминало оригинал с 10 метров. А по факту - это очередной хлам"
907,Right one fake
908,Where can I buy the fake one.
909,He/she need to make his own brand......maybe they are better than the ripper.....
910,"Where can one buy this watch? ALL the Replica sites show stock photos of the real watches. Never of the replicas that they sell. Every time I've asked for a picture, they show a cheap movement not even remotely resembling the real one."
911,VERY BEAUTIFUL FAKE....
912,This is Pathetik. They shouldn't clone 😠🤬
913,Jenni do you maybe know the Chinese factory of this watch? The website I mean...
914,Not a fan of replicas..... but after watching this video.... i am not sure anymore. Lol
915,Europe focusing his industry only on luxury products is very dangerous and a little bit suicidal...
916,The replica looks better? How
917,"This is why clones are so popular , no one and I mean no one that sees a good fake will know or care if its a fake or not ."
918,Thanks for convincing me to get one.
919,Fake one is actually not a cheap watch. So it is real watch that i cant afford.
920,Nice Rolex on your wrist Jenni
921,"You will be surprised how little people not into watches know about watches...... I have this buddy who showed me his Omega which some guy lost to him in a poker game. Dude was proud that he won an Omega. It was painful to point out to him that its a fake. He didn't believe me at first but then I showed him my 1000 dollar GSAR and the make and quality of the thing just tosses his Omega in the trash. And, you know, thats' not supposed to happen. My GSAR is indeed pretty well built but it should not significantly feel more quality than a 6k dollars Omega. It should be the other way around. Being the watch snob I am I sniffed that out pretty easily but my dude did not. He's not short of money too he buys luxury(real ones) clothings and electronics and stuff. But just don't know that much about watches."
922,"$60,000. Stainless steel watches are fakes too.  They are simply fakes for bigger fools, willing and able to part with their money. Mr. Patek and mister Phillipe must be rolling in their graves, or having a real laugh!"
923,buy the fake one. period! i dont have a watch and never will!!!!!!!!!
924,The fake watch is the one on the left
925,I I’ll buy the fake! Too hard to spot the difference n it tells the time!
926,Makes me wonder if my hundred dollar Seco is a fake.
927,It’s important to watch this to avoid making a $63k mistake and buying the real one. ;-)
928,"If the fake watch costs $500 and they still make a profit, yet they can make them to such high quality, imagine how much bubbles there are in the price of the real one. Also this isn't even the highest grade clone."
929,I dont mind wearing a fake watch if it was done right. There are some occasions that you need to wear fake watches like a movie set where you need to have expensive watch as a prop or if you are a spy.
930,"I understand why some people wear a replica of a £5k watch. But even if the replica quality is THIS good, everyone in the world is going to know it’s fake. The average chap driving his Hyundai ain’t gonna be wearing a Patek."
931,"If you need a microscope to spot the difference, then the fakers did an amazing job. You dont think theres Chinese businessmen sporting a fake watch that were sold to them for 20-30k?"
932,The so called replica is as good as the original. No one is going to check your watch with a microscope to spot the difference.
933,"I buy watches for the case design or the dial art, I don't care about the movement as long as it works I've had more Swiss movements just stop working for no reason unlike the Japanese  movements that seem to be bullet proof.  I would rather buy the ""fake"" cause I'm not a pretentious douche that needs to show off how much money I have to other people by buying a name.  I wouldn't call the fake one a fake. I'd call it a copy.  they still had to put a lot of time and energy into making it.  And as long as it's not being passed of as a  legit one and Is a fair price I would buy it.  where can I get one?"
934,fake is on the right and the only tell is the finish appears smoother on the left
935,"Buying & Supporting Made in Swiss Products to Preserve Great Craftmanships & Good Working Environment for the Employees! We should go & witness by ourselves just how Bad the treatments & working conditions of these "" Sweat Shops "" are in these Third World Countries! If we keep on supporting these Money Minded but Heartless Contract Bosses ... Our children might end up working under these ruthless businessmen! 🕯"
936,The clone does the same thing... maybe even better
937,Jenni you are truely a lovely woman
938,"Of course, they cannot be distinguished, since the original and the fake are made in China"
939,"Now she has told  everyone and the replica producer what's wrong with the replica. The next generation will be even harder to tell apart from the original. 

People will buy the replica for 1000-2000 dollar and think they bought the real one, not knowing how much the original costs, which is way more. It's good we got someone to tell us what to avoid."
940,"I find it hilarious when I hear people say that a brand name replica is a fake.  If it keeps time, its a real watch.  I pity the fools that spend such massive amounts of money on unimportant objects to elevate their status•"
941,"I picked the colour difference up basically straight away. But that is one fine copy. If it weren't for the scheming intentions behind this fake, I'd almost have to congratulate them on a job well done!"
942,"Anyone knows the website of the fakes? I'm down for it, seriously"
943,"I think you are missing the point about replica watches..First of all im not defending the replica manufacturers.. But I think it brings  a valuable lesson here that some of you don’t see or pretend not to see the ugly truth... If the chinese can replicate a high end watch like a PP down to the movement and all mechanism, even if its not a 100% but maybe 90% replica.. it tells you that these manufactures are charging an obscene amount of money for a genuine high end watch.. let me put it in other words, these manufacturers in china spend maybe 150 to 200 usd to manufacture a 1:1 clone of a 57000 Usd watch, how much do you think Patek spends to manufacture such watch? Do you think they spend 80% or 70% of the retail price? Of course not..Im not saying they spend 200 usd like the chinese, obviously they use better material and machinery.. but I think it would be safe to say they spend around 2 or 3 k usd to manufacture a watch worth 57000 usd.. Think about it !!"
944,You need to do a wrist check Jenni.
945,"Stop buying clones so that you can get views....... You are funding the criminal Underworld. The biggest tell your are buying a fake patak will be the price, it's not rocket science. Anyone spending $60,000 on a watch isn't going to be handing it over on eBay. You're fooling nobody...."
946,"The fake is brilliant, but it’s still 100% fake, even if it matches the genuine article 100%. It’s about time that these fake watch manufacturers started designing their own watches now that they have got hold of advanced manufacturing equipment to stamp out decent quality parts for their fake production lines."
947,"Seems like the comment section is filled with people who doesn’t understand watches and came across this video because it went sort of viral. Hi, welcome: $1000 Jordans and Yeezys are even more overpriced given the fact that they are made by some kid in god know where. Unlike the overpriced sneakers you like to buy “expensive” watches shows you the work of artist and watchmakers working together to build something as close to perfection as possible. That’s why a real enthusiast is able to spot so many imperfections in a fake watch. The same way no one buys a million dollar painting to cover a hole in the wall, no one buys a 200k watch to see the time"
948,Sold...where can I buy the fake!
949,Just change fake lable to real and real lable to fake.. and we will believe that too
950,"Sometimes another good way to tell if it is a real or a fake is to ask the seller to put it on a timegrapher. These replicas very rarely manage to perform within the specifications that the original does. If the seller refuses, maybe don't trust them"
951,The right one is a fake
952,if the fake one sale for $99.99 it will be a big hit!
953,My citizen looks better
954,So where do they sell this horrendous fakes again? asking for a friend
955,Give us a link so we can all buy the replica please Jenni.
956,I would never pay that much for a watch. Ridiculous. Thank goodness for fake ones. Lol. It's not my favorite watch design regardless. It's amazing craftsmanship and detail but for that kind of price I'd buy a new car.
957,"Fake Ist Fake , and crime , second Swiss watch for ever ,fake months ."
958,"Has she said from the beginning to the end of this video, that the replica was made in China? Why do so many people satirize China here?"
959,"The replica looks better.
1. I am not ok with companies charging 60,000 for something that still won’t keep time as well as a  Japanese quartz. 
2. If you can’t tell at a glance that a fake is a fake, then why get the real one? "
960,"I think the one on the left is fake, but frankly, it's just a guess."
961,I'd buy the replica! 😂
962,"Amazing the comments by some watch enthusiasts.
You can wireless earbuds from your local garage for £20, you can buy air pods for £130, Sennheiser for £270 or custom made In Ear Monitors for £3000.
Each step up is reflected in a linear £ for quality increase. It is more of exponential graph & quality isn't just the sound, its the reliability. "
963,There are no fake Vostok Amphibias.
964,"If the 500 euro watch is well built and has a pretty accurate movement, them why the hell shouldn’t you buy it?
And serious: 60k for a steel watch???"
965,"The real 60000 euro mistake would be to buy the original, just because it's original. It's a simple movement, and the design is half a century old. The design and development costs have long been payed for, and the basic steel one doesn't justify this price at all, just because it has a slightly better movement.
If you can have about 90% of the quality for 59500 euros less, than it's really foolish to pay that much for a frickin' watch... whatever the watch purists say, it's not worth it. Only people who are so rich they have nothing better to spend on will buy at that price... for us regular folks, there are the replicas in every price range if we like a particular watch, but no way in hell we could afford the original."
966,Not matter how good they copied. U know himself that u have a Replika on wrist. thats enuff. u liying yourself. and no watch Worth 60k. its only Merchandising that make the price high
967,I will start a microbrand called Fillip Patel and sell that watch.
968,"For the same money I think I'll take the fake, and a Corvette. Most women probably don't care about me having a Patek Philippe."
969,Not sure what a fake watch is .I  know what a copy of a premium brand watch is.
970,the crown of the replica is even better than the gen
971,Where ur buy this amazing and perfect cheap patek?
972,Both ugly. .
973,"To be honest. I don’t want to pay 60k for Gerald Genta’s legendary design. I’d rather have it for 500. This is a hobby, not a bankruptcy contest."
974,Am I correct in thinking the real Patek movement doesn't hack? If the fake is based on a Miyota then that possibly will hack when the crown is pulled out.
975,Man this comment section is super toxic. If you have a shit ton of money and you want to spend some of it on a high end precision time piece/piece of jewelry good on you. If not that’s fine you can get a great watch for a reasonable price. But scamming people by making a fake a product is not cool.
976,"That shows you overpriced watches is stupid. I dont understand why a man will buy a house on his wrist. It's a joke, no watch should be worth that kind of money"
977,I don't like fakes but you have to commend the effort and quality...
978,"I like the fake better for the cheap price...😂🤣😅,even if I have the money,I won't spend 60k in a watch..!"
979,this shows that paying tens of thousands of dollars on watches is idiotic and absurd.  This 60 thousands dollar watch was replicated under 500 dollars and needs magnifying glass to tell the difference. lol how stupid.
980,I like The klone. I colekt klone watch.🙂
981,"I feel sorry for the people with such low self esteem that they have to buy a fake watch, you are basically lying to people and yourself every time you wear it, sad. No I can't afford a 60k watch but even if I could I would not own a PP 5711 a Sub or a Royal Oak as most people will just assume it's a fake."
982,I would pay $300USD for the fake
983,"i wouldn't personally buy a fake for either 500 euro or 60k euro. But honestly, I don't see so much difference in the original PP to be ready to pay 59500 euro more for it. You can find good microbrand homage to Nautilus for 500 euro and you won't need to wait a lifetime to buy them, like you would with the original"
984,"The problem remains I will get my hand chopped off for £500 rather than £60,000"
985,There is no pleasure in owning a fake watch
986,The Fake is the best hhhhh
987,If you let Jeff Bezos wear the fake one everyone would guess wrong including Jenni Elle !!!
988,So a Patek Phillipe watch is a overpriced watch that only stupid people buy and can be made for 500 dollar and stupid people pay 60000 dollar for just to see what time it is.
989,ill buy the fake
990,There is thousands of idiots that blew 60 grand on fake watch but at the end of the day they didn't spend their own 60 grand. No one buys 60 grand watch with money they actually earned with own hands
991,Where I can buy fake patek.
992,Only a stupid spend 60k for a watch
993,I'm okay with replica :)
994,"But you will need a microscope to see all these ""imperfections""!"
995,"You could really leave out the mixed hyper american and british accents. A native speaker can tell that you aren't one and thats fine, but trying an accent and then mixing them up is pretty confusing. Good video though :)"
996,who wares such a ugly watch? I don't care if it have millions parts with brain neurons complications that can access your consciousness... it's an ugly design.
997,"Alright, Alright......... It's BEAUTIFUL to see a LADY into watches!   😏  🌷  👍"
998,Both have horrible design
999,"Wow, the Patek movement engraving looks amazing in detail. Seems like a step too far ... but I guess that's why it's a Patek."
1000,4:41 some dust on the glass or?
1001,"There are imperfections on the real watch too(6:11), a dust particle maybe. But the dial material on two watches is obviously different under magnifying glass."
1002,Finishing is pretty damn good - i mean if u need a loop to tell a difference...   if these dummies put effort into making their own watches they'd probably do a good job
1003,3:21 / 3:24 the movement movement
1004,I'll take 2 replicas and and an order of fries with that to go.
1005,"Great video, though I wish we would all stop using the term 'replica' or 'clone' and refer to them only as 'fake'. The lack of respect for Intellectual Property in countries that allow this to happen is pathetic."
1006,Thank you 🙏 ✔️
1007,"Mrs Jenni you are absolutely adorable,, and your videos are very clear, concise and, honestly now my favorite watch videos.
Even if it was not an adorable you I will still watch these videos. Thank you ma'am."
1008,"Great review, you're the biggest treasure here."
1009,I can't even afford the replica.  🤣
1010,"Could you please stop using the word ""replica"" in your videos and change that for ""counterfeit"" for instance?
Some of your videos seem as though the pay respect to forgery.
This is a serious matter and selling fakes is considered a crime in many countries."
1011,"I had it right within a split second because you had a reference watch. The ""Geneve"" writing gave it away.

So I just watched the entire video, this is my afterthoughts of the lettering. Take a closer look at the lettering when you had those watches far away, the fake Geneve looks less sharp than the real Geneve lettering. "
1012,This video might be the best drinking game of all time. Just take a shot everytime she says authentic. You will pass out long before the end.
1013,China Fake Watch COMPANY (CFWC) : Thank you for the improvement recommendations. Please review our new version 2.0.
1014,"Excellent Jenni, replicas have come on significantly in quality since the 80`s nicely presented, thank you, regards Andrew"
1015,1:11 the right one seems fake
1016,An old man from 1970 called. He wants his watch back.
1017,"I'm honest: I recognized it immediately, from the color tone of the dial, my uncle has a Nautilus and I see it every day.  But otherwise it would have been difficult ..."
1018,"Great video! Also the bracelet is different; on the replica there is a gap, a little step, between the case and the first mesh."
1019,"Archie Luxury told me none of your viewers are real viewers.... So now I'm not sure I'm real.  

Though I suppose my complete lack of interest in Patek is likely enough for Archie to consider me not real. Keep up the great work!"
1020,"Maybe I missed it, but does it also tell the time correctly? :)"
1021,"Hi Jenni, the tip regarding the hands, what magnification is required to see them?"
1022,Please fix that nails. I cannot emphasize to express my horror seeing dirt under your nails. C'mon
1023,I just don't understand how PP convince people that their watch worth 60K? Replica is not 120 times worse than original. Maybe 3 times only
1024,I'll just keep my Timex--thank you
1025,"I’d plump for the rep any day. Cheaper, looks as good, tells the time like the real one and if you lost it, broke it or were mugged for it, it wouldn’t be such a loss. And besides I can’t afford to pay for a real one, plus I don’t really like them anyway, I prefer my replica omega plant ocean, has kept perfect time over the last 4 years, it’s fooled jewellers so it must be good."
1026,"You kind of are helping the counterfeiters, by using words like high end and gushing over how it’s such a good replica."
1027,"then you have not seen the AP ROO, 3 companies in china make AP watches, one is just like an original cost 500 USD..."
1028,They're Getting Better....😮
1029,all you have to do is look at the edges of the hour and minute hand!......the real watch has very shiny well-finished hour and minute hand!
1030,They used to sell for 50 USD...Covid effect?
1031,That amplitude regulator was the dead giveaway.
1032,How can the finishing both be slightly\ significantly different ? I think you mean to say with your eyes they are about the same looking but under magnification the you see a bigger difference ?
1033,"I'd say the one on the left is real, the face just looks smoother to me, but I'll find out soon"
1034,I hate bootlegs!!! Where exactly do they sell those so that I can avoid them. Lol
1035,4:39 still amazing that for the money PP don't polish the underside of the second hand.
1036,Wow for a replica it’s beautiful. It’s funny they never get the proportions right.
1037,"Who can to buy a Patek Philippe, has the money to buy protection. With your clone, you could suffer some problem on the streets :)"
1038,Amazing video you awesome !
1039,"Won't lie, these watches are great if you are going for a night out and don't want to risk a looter / mugger taking your grail..."
1040,Where do you find these super clone replicas?
1041,Can tell by the “Patek” font when compared side by side
1042,60.000€ union job.
1043,"Jenni, tell me where you bought the fake watch.  :-)  
I can buy the same or another, please tell us."
1044,after your video replica get more better quality )))
1045,"love the channel, Jenni! some may say this is educational regarding spotting fakes but i feel simply giving this watch publicity only compounds the problem down the road. not only will more people buy the fake but the fakers will only get better too. just saying..."
1046,Pants in Horology House
1047,"I always wondered what China does with the one real watch they buy to base all the copies after. Does the boss keep it? And even if he does,who would believe it's real outside the Chinese factory?
It's almost like there is no real luxury in China. It's all copied and substandard crap."
1048,Left is real. Only tell by the line from the watch head through the top of the bracelet.
1049,cant even afford the replica.
1050,Are the parts interchangeable? I'm very curious. Because if they are... that is a perfect clone.
1051,She's cute
1052,0:18 the watch shown in intro had scratches on the right side. As no content creater would put a fake watch on their intro so I look for that scratch when looking at them both at the same time and I know the one with scratches is the real one.easy.
1053,left is authentic?
1054,"the fact that you are comparing them,  gives to the replica a great boost for glory and pride.  i will choose the replica always, even i had 1 trillion $ in my account. question of morality. the real cost of the patek is not more than 2-3000 , in my opinion. all the rest is money for the yachts, homes, party, jewelery, trips, of the owners"
1055,btw  dear jenni. please post he link of the replica website. this one was really nice.
1056,When even watch experts struggle to tell the difference it just tells you how the luxury brands hike their prices up! The genuine Patek might well be worth 6k but 60k!!??
1057,Link to the replica?
1058,The conclusion is it’s more than dumb to buy a $60 000 watch you are basically buying a very expensive name rather than a watch.
1059,"little in microscopic difference but only 1/120 of that REAL price,what can a poor consumer demand more?"
1060,"you are reviewing the v3 of the fake, the v4 just got released haha"
1061,who pays 500 euros into a fake watch!!! in that budget you can buy something really nice.
1062,Where my r/chinarep boys?
1063,where do i get the fakes? please direct me @Jenni Elle
1064,"and which Jewellery retailer did you work for?   It's just I worked for 2, and I'd struggle to tell a fake from real.     You may be correct,  as your fake is just too bad and thus easy to tell - but a proper fake?  and I doubt you'd know, as real fakes are so good the only way to tell is to open up the back and check the parts,  except that also requires special knowledge which most people wouldn't have."
1065,"I have an F900 Citizen Satellite Wave in titanium. It has a sapphire bezel. It is always correct to the second because of its GPS synch. When I go abroad, it automatically moves to the correct time zone. It has an alarm loud enough to wake me from any stage of sleep, it's waterproof to 10 atmospheres, it has a chronograph function, and it tells me the day of the week in case I forget."
1066,Nice video but please check you audio volume and do it up to broadcasting standard. Its way too quiet.
1067,What’s the link for the rep watch? Thanks
1068,I'd like know where u buy the clone from for research purpose of course.
1069,Where can I get that replica quality?
1070,they both look same
1071,"I was going to edit my original comment to add this, but the date dial, is it just me or on the fake does the numbers look slightly bolder (thicker) than the original?"
1072,Where do I buy that replica???
1073,Where can i buy this replica
1074,Where can I buy the replica watch?
1075,"I have a rep 5711 just as good as this, ill never be able to afford the real thing, yet I absolutely love the watch. Its thin compared to any expensive automatic watch"
1076,"So if tomorrow there would be absolutely no difference with the original watch, questions is why would I pay this much money?"
1077,"Left is real, i think."
1078,Hello.
1079,"60k  watch I will not buy used. So no chance of getting scammed, but for 500 bucks, I will but that replica."
1080,Nothing about the weight?
1081,Pretty impressive. Biggest giveaway in my opinion however is the shallow crown guards on the rep.
1082,where can we got one lol
1083,"The $60000 mistake is buying the authentic, 🧐 I can save all that $$$$ and have the same thing for $500  and not have to worry about getting it stolen."
1084,China has entered the chat
1085,"On one hand, this video is good for helping us consumers learn the differences.  On the other hand, this video is also good for helping fakers learn which parts they need to fix to make better fakes."
1086,The brush of the stainless steel was so obvious from the first shot... and the genuine articles case was significantly more obviously aesthetically pleasing...
1087,"looks similar but no same :-) its about experience , so who wore fake watches has fake mindset :)"
1088,Hard to compare one watch cost 50k the other 500 bucks
1089,"Hey, where's the link to buy the replica?!"
1090,People are saying the real is a ripoff but they forget that the real watch holds its value if not most of the time increase in value.
1091,I think alot of people will be more impressed with the replica than the real Nautilus itself.
1092,"If the replica was made by a real Swiss watch manufacturer as it is now they would charge atleast £20,000 not 500 euros lol"
1093,is there a website for this watch ?
1094,Authentic on the left.
1095,The authentic one is on the left
1096,left is real
1097,"If you can get it for $500, why would you pay $50,000+ to get an identical one?"
1098,Excellent video Jenni
1099,"It's crap and you can see the difference, and if your buying these watches, you should be opening it up"
1100,Right
1101,I picked before you showed which was which
1102,"Sorry but I will buy the rep, if I like the watch that much after wearing it for a year. I can always buy the gen after. And if your rep get stolen who cares! If will buy the v2 after 😂"
1103,"Only fools will buy €60,000 watch and think it's an investment."
1104,"That's not a 500€ Patek Philippe replica. At that price range you're getting a 1:1, at least the front would look identical. There are many high end replica makers , some better than others."
1105,I found these 300 aus in Melbourne.
1106,I will buy the replica and save my money.
1107,Lol if you wanna be practical these days just buy the replica
1108,left is authentic
1109,If the Nautilus never existed and this was an original watch on it's own it would be incredible for the price.  Technically it still is but because it's a copy of something else it will never be perceived as good as it really is.  It's unfortunate that black market money is what's funding these kinds of watches.
1110,I would not buy fake watch even for $1.00. In my mind I will always know I am lying when someone ask me about my watch on my wrist. Bad karma.
1111,I need the link for that fake lol
1112,"I read a comment somewhere, can't remember where, in which a Chinese guy said that genuine Rolex's were $80 watches.  By which he meant that this was the cost to manufacture them in China.  I understand that Patek pay considerably more attention to the details, especially the movement.  But if a $6 k Rolex can be made for $80, then on this metric a $60 k Patek can be made for ~$800!"
1113,Patel philippe
1114,"You order 10000 legit watches to be made , the parallel factories make 200,000 more for the black market. With internet, they know how much you sell and they are the guys who do the hard work. You are destroying your own brand by outsourcing."
1115,"Take me for example, I have a ""fake"" well finished Rolex Oyster Perpetual for $350 (US dollars) and took the rest of the money to invest and traveling and I'm just 23 years old. I can't picture my self spending thousands of dollars on a watch If I love traveling more than watches. That's my experience so far. No regrets. Great video!! I subscribed."
1116,Do you have the link of the fake one?
1117,"PP is of course overpriced. As a jewelry, it also looks cheap."
1118,Soooo where can we buy this fake? Lol
1119,can someone give me the link for the fake one ?
1120,"It’s great that there is something for every one, some people love to buy cheap copy’s others prefer the real thing.  I can only recommend that people visit the Patek facility or indeed any other high end watch house (I don’t include Rolex, who I agree are the antithesis of marketing over quality) before trying to convince others and themselves that watches made in Chinese sweat shops by machine rather than man has anything whatsoever to do with horology.  Perhaps this channel could show its viewers what really goes into creating and bring to market new high end watch, rather than promoting the counterfeiting trade which results in the exploitation a misery of women, children and men all over the world."
1121,Left is the authentic
1122,Where can I buy one? lol
1123,If they doesn't look able to afford it then likely its a rep. If they do then it does not matter
1124,"3:22, you've repeated yourself 2 times :) just saying, otherwise the video is great. Thankyou :)"
1125,"you know what shocked me? Just look at 7min and 40secs of the vid. Everything around the glass cover plate isn't polished! 55000 dollars. And if you look up close the fake has a more finished level on that detail. It's also matte but because it's like this on the original. Actual big WTF, even my automatic chinese Tonghji 49 dollar replica nautilus without branding, sterile version is polished on the back, believe me it is a big difference when you look at the watch."
1126,But you buy one of these and you're just cheating yourself.
1127,"tell us please, where is the source to buy the replica :p"
1128,"It's not even worth it to buy a real watch anymore. The difference isn't worth $80,000"
1129,I like the fake one more..i know it sounds stupid but its just my feeling.
1130,thats the reason I never go for rolex cause rolex mos fakes out there and rolex do not have glass back ....very hard to spot
1131,The replica would only cost about $50 to make in China. So at $500+ it is massively profitable.
1132,"China make entire ETA swiss movement in China...well finished ..only difference is weight and thickness and also they are not long lasting, work 2-3 years max"
1133,So I should pay 10x for minor details 🤔 then I should feel bad about buyin somethin similar 🤔🤔 All for somethin that only tells time. My phone can tell me the time. A watch is a watch is a watch..
1134,thought women could not understand from the watches
1135,Ce genre de vidéo permet aux gens de ne pas se faire arnaquer mais elle permet aussi aux faussaires d'améliorer leurs produits...
1136,"I have a Tissot Le Locle of 480 Euro. I have a feeling 500 Euro is about the price where you can get a decent watch with all the boxes ticked, like applied markers, nicely centered date window, sapphire glass, decent timekeeping using an ETA workhorse-movement, …
Both the real and the fake are very nice watches, I think it's a bit of a 'first world problem' to get worked up about this. I guess it devaluates the brand a lot if people wearing them are in first place labelled 'fake watch wearers' at first impression."
1137,Who knows the fake one? I would use it
1138,"Who is the maker of the replica watch? There is many factories and the quality different. The movement’s “original ETA” can be found on the 1 to 1 replica. For all the differences you mentioned in your video, I would pay for your watch 600€ only 😜"
1139,I could probably convince myself to buy a fake seiko but a fake  Patek no way.
1140,What a bloody rip off charging people £60k for a watch. WTF.
1141,my option: buy the fake one and a nice car with the other 59.500 dollars. thanks.
1142,I recently came face to face with the temptation to buy a replica. it was a yacht master that was so well done I could not tell the difference even when compared to the real thing that I had access at the time but I kept coming back to the same thought which was that while most people would be fooled I would always know I wore a fake. Now if only these people would put their talent to making something original.
1143,You are somehow promoting fake watches ! Stop these videos !
1144,None of these irregularities would be spotted by someone walking past/sitting next to you if the person walking past or sitting next to you even knew what and who Patek Phillipe is... I’ve been deliberating over buying a rep for a long time I have a great website which has great reviews. I think the Nautillus is a bit too obvious something like the aquanaut is probably something I’d get away with
1145,"You really don't need a loupe to see the hands and determine that it's a fake. The dial color, while at first glance looks good, is still wrong and poorly finished, the Patek Philippe branding also looks thin and fake. The finish of the movement gives it away."
1146,Ten past ten did a review on the fake Audemars Piguet 15500. Will you be covering this watch? Unfortunately i was not able to understand the review since I do not speak german
1147,Replica looks better
1148,I think most people would only  buy a Patek from a reputable dealer. But I supposed one could be caught out at a none premium watch auction. To be honest I would be the fake for $500 just for the fun of it. The reason being is an onlooker cannot tell the difference on your arm and nice watches open doors.
1149,"For these fake watch manufacturers, they just need some creative designer and good advertisers . I believe they can make perfect own watch for a reasonable price."
1150,the fact that you can make a replica easily for so cheap tells that luxury watches are way too overpriced. just low tech luxury goods where you pay 90% for the brand and image.
1151,"FUNNY THING: Fake ones works the same, looks the same and lasts you as long as real one. No reason to waste money :D :D"
1152,The biggest tell on any replica is that the replica movement is not free sprung (meaning the timing is adjusted by screws on the balance wheel instead of s regulator) I have never seen a fake replicate this including in other fakes like Rolex and Omega
1153,"How can a watch made out of stainless steel cost 60Ks? At this price point only white gold should be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, it is a very bad looking watch. Perfection in ugliness. I would not wear it even if the real one”s cost was 500$."
1154,I can’t afford the original. Can someone please link the fake?
1155,"Anyone who cares about authenticity of a PP is going to go to a legit AD. In other words, no one who cares about legitimacy thinks they’re getting a real PP for 500 euro. 
So, only cheesy posers are buying these copies. They are well-made copies, sure...but they are copies nonetheless. There are plenty of legitimate watch companies that make excellent-quality pieces for around 500 euro. A person who isn’t trying to fool others would get one of those. These copies may be as good as an authentic 500 euro Seiko, you say. Perhaps. But people don’t buy fake PPs for the quality of the fake (which will offer no service or warranty of any kind), do they? If that were the case, fakers would make their own brand at this quality and price point, as there would be no market in the fake game."
1156,Where can i get this fake watch? For educational purposes
1157,"If you can make a fake that decent, why not just make your own original watches?"
1158,"Those who want to buy a fake, be careful, you may come across a double fake!"
1159,Is it just me that thinks the nautilus is ugly
1160,è più bello quello fake
1161,"China has absolutely no respect for intellectual property. How great would a watch be from this factory that had a unique style and brand? Build something for yourself, don’t copy. Don’t support these fakers either."
1162,I don't think I would have been able to spot this fake if sold as authentic.
1163,"OK, I will inform the factory to improve the design."
1164,"Apparently the content producer does not read her own comments.  She just make videos and is unaware of her viewer's comment.  The truth about these so called ""LUXURY WATCHES.'' Is that they are ONLY recognized by the ""Watch Snobs"".  In the eyes of average Joe & Jane, they are close enough for $500.  Most of the people who don't care about watches wouldn't pay $500 for a fake, nor will they spend 60k on a GEN.  In addition, ones that will recognize this watch is one that are into it.  To most folks, the 5711 is nothing but another watch we can careless about.  So to pinpoint the difference is absurd.  Are you going to ask someone who has that watch on ""is that real? Let me compare it.""  What if that person is someone who is well dressed in a suit and looked like he can afford it.  What about a rich teen came from old money who's dad gave him a real watch but he dressed in sneakers and jeans with a T shirt.. You'll automatically assume it's a fake."
1165,"Don’t buy fake copies, unless it’s simply a matter of what you want others to think! Wast of hard earned money!"
1166,Fake Patek with better finish then any Tag Heur
1167,The one on the right is the fake
1168,Thats horrible and disgusting! Where?
1169,I like the replica more haha 🤣
1170,"Consider that most people who own a Patek are well educated. I think we can all agree as to that fact.  Naturally it follows that as educated people, how would an educated person be willing to fork out the equivalent of a Mercedes SUV to own a watch that is, as you say, indistinguishable from the authentic.  I like corporations.  i dont like replicas. However there should be security features and millwork, handwork etc. that are too expensive for a company to replicate. Essentially, if PP's watch can be easily replicated for $500, then they are simply not producing watch of sufficient quality."
1171,The fake actually looks better if you ask me.
1172,i want whis watch.. how i can find this?
1173,just more proof the originals are way over priced and not worth the cost
1174,"""I am to show you how to spot a fake right away"" girllll you speak A LOT before getting to the point."
1175,"In my opinion, fake watchmakers are getting to the point where there movements are being made with the same materials and machines the official brands are using. If another company can make the watch for $1000 or less and we're happy to pay $65,000 for the same thing but it's been stamped by a brand, then maybe we have to ask ourselves, have we let these watch companies get above their station? With the Nautilus I would say that's a big o'l yes!"
1176,"Both are ugly looking watches.500 is best option for me, i hate overpirced watches"
1177,where did you buy it? i want one
1178,"This shows anyone just truly how much that original Patek truly is worth.  Nothing close to what they are asking for it. :-)
The Chinese are actually doing the end buyer a favor in this case."
1179,"if u rich, u wear fake, also people say real; if u poor, u wear real, also people say fake."
1180,This channel is becoming like horology house comparing real and fakes. Soon will she be selling them too like that dude?
1181,"The only way not to make a huge mistake and pay €60,000 for a fake is pay €500 for a fake."
1182,I'm buying the fake!
1183,I prefer the fake it costs only € 500 and I have money left for the Porsche 😜
1184,"Amazing review, I loved the details and the spot-on comments about the mechanism and the finish. Yet, I have a major problem with all of this.... WHERE'S THE FREAKING LINK TO THE WATCH????????????? I want to buy me one!!!!!"
1185,The right one is fake
1186,"The clever fakers are putting original movement in faked case and straps and fake box and papers. I was offerred a fake Hublot F1 with diamond bezel. the case and movement were fake. real strap and clasp as clasp is big giveaway on these but the diamonds were real? that is going almost the full hog to get away with it. the diamonds were worth more than the watch, very odd?"
1187,"Little people realize this is the price of a tesla... and doesn’t even get close to the quality and technology offered by tesla... not to mention the actual price of the materials used in the watch compared with the car.
And yes i know I’m comparing a car with a watch but I’m not the one that is selling a watch for the price of a luxury car..."
1188,"Here's a question: If people can clone original watches so perfectly that there's 0% difference, then what will be the point of having the originals?"
1189,Do you know why the fake watches are getting better and better every day!? It is of because of people like you who tells them what they have done wrong so the next time the fake watch designers will take your point in account and will reform their mistake. Actually YOU are the people who are helping them getting better and better..
1190,I don't understand why someone would knowingly buy a fake
1191,anybody can fake a PP. you wont see fake spring drive or Oceanus.
1192,"Honestly who cares. Who’s gonna drop 60K on a watch that’s watching this? If you enjoy it, buy the fake for a couple hundred, enjoy it, and just don’t lie about it if asked. Enjoy life."
1193,"If I had a real one, I'd probably buy the fake to wear around town.  The real one is an investment piece.  Why worry about scratching it, when it should really be sitting in a vault to gain value.  Only time to ever wear the real one is when you've got to get $60K out of the country on your wrist :)  Losing a $60K nautilus in a street robbery is unacceptable.  If the Swiss German woman in the watch industry needs a magnifying glass to tell the difference, then why not just pass it off.  But alas, the only place I'd ever wear a $60K hunk of gunk on my wrist is Vegas or Asia.  Otherwise it's too much watch for almost any kind of business deal or board room setting, at least on America's west coast, except for maybe Hollywood."
1194,"Crap subject, crap statements, crap presenter. So bad. Those aren't her hands, she does nothing originl, just copies stuff from elsewhere and provides no useful insight. Sad."
1195,Dislikes are from the fake dealers
1196,"From the fake, it's obvious, the actual manufacturing cost of a Patek Philippe is around 500 euros, another 10% will be spent in advertisement and sales promotion. The rest is profit for the company. Almost 80% of the value of luxury watches is derived from perception and artificial exclusivity it creates, not from the real value a customer derives from it. Also, these items are perfect for people who want to invest or irrationally spent income generated from fraudulent activities."
1197,I think that right one is fake
1198,"who in their right mind is getting this close to you to see if your watch is fake or not! just wear it and enjoy. nobody has ever stopped me to look at my watch. If you like the way it looks, who gives a shit what it cost."
1199,"We're 1:10 in and I'm basically guessing the one on the left is genuine, I think the grips on the crown look sharper, the SSteel brushing looks smoother too. Fingers crossed"
1200,I need to figure out how to get production quality.
1201,9:15 I can’t believe the winding and setting feels almost the same on the fake 🤔😳
1202,Is there one to win on your channel ? I miss thé others games 🤣
1203,"I think the one you hold in your right hand, there is something about the finnish that makes i catch the light in a wierd way."
1204,"I missed a few words about the clasp.Thanks for the video Jenni, great work!"
1205,The only difference I care is my own credence of knowing it is real. Vice versa.
1206,are there long waiting lists for the perfect replica P P  s ! And do they sell for over retail !
1207,"My $400 replica Seamaster keeps better time than my $6000 genuine one. The rep is less than +1.5 seconds per day, and the real one is closer to +4."
1208,the reviewer is proud to share that the datewheel looks different. Hopefully she will learn soon that some people are modifying their replica with genuine datewheel 😂
1209,I am guessing the left one from my view when watching the video.
1210,the nautilus is so perfect
1211,Authentic on the left - the one on the right just seems rougher. (Answered 1:11 in).
1212,The engraving of real patek movements are also done by a machine not by hand.
1213,Ouuhh comming from watchvice :D
1214,New subscriber here! Your videos are amazing!
1215,Left authentic right replica 👌🏿
1216,"I'm not that interested in watches. I must admit I watch your videos mainly because you are so cute. The videos are great, though."
1217,There is a clone 324 movement in production with correct location of balance wheel etc.
1218,I'm going to fall in love with you and your accent soon ;-) good work Jenni . Great videos.
1219,"Scary....
You would have to have a loope to tell most of these differences. Especially without a side by side piece."
1220,Well explained .. Thanks
1221,Do a side by side comparison of the Hublot Classic Fusion 42mm.  I believe that is truly a 1:1 replica.  My friend bought a replica thinking it was real only to find out it was fake a year later.
1222,I think PP should include an electron microscope with every watch ( but ensure the EM is from an AD). Some guy in China is now working to improve his forgerery in 7 different areas. Thank you for bring this to us☘
1223,Great video! Earned yourself a sub!
1224,Not even the best replica of the nautilus that's available🤣
1225,So someone got 59500 € to spend few extra hours on polishing the details of the real one. Thats not a bad salary per hour.
1226,Could you do a one for the audemars piguet as well?
1227,"well, now that you have told them the finer points I'm sure that they will make adjustments to make the replica even better.  lol..."
1228,"Crown, its always the crown for amy replica for any brands"
1229,Is this from Horology House? Good comparison.
1230,you are particular gorgeous
1231,You have to give the Chinese credit for producing this superb replica - just shows how much you get ripped off buying the original product.
1232,left watch
1233,Man this is the sort of video that could get you in trouble babe. Thierry Stern gonna come gunning for ya!
1234,Thankfully I could spot the fake one . It woulda hurt me
1235,Left one is real??
1236,"Ich wusste doch, dass ich das Video schonmal gesehen habe... mir ist erst jetzt aufgefallen das Kai&Du die gleichen Videos im gleichen Studio dreht haha"
1237,You gave me enough reasons not to buy the real one....first one the price
1238,A beautiful lady who is passionate & knowledgeable about stunning watches. Have 'we' just discovered the perfect wife/girlfriend?
1239,Thank you Jenni very accurate and precise video! Incredible fake tough this 5711
1240,"Wouldn’t take too long before the machine can easily duplicate the same fit and finish of high end luxury watches. But worry not, then the luxury brands will market imperfections and sell the watch for a ridiculous margin."
1241,Brilliant video Jenni but PLEASE stop the  music🎵 Your voice and the content are all that is needed but I find myself listening to the repeating music that drives me nuts. Maybe just me 😂
1242,Theres a version 4 pit which has made the colour the same
1243,One other difference that I noticed is the complete lack of dust on the original dial.
1244,Ya buy the overpriced junk when the copy is just as good
1245,Left is the one
1246,What about the lume
1247,after watching this the fake watch makers will improve their fake watches even more lol
1248,Imagine watching this and half way through the video realizing you own a fake patek is fake😐🙃
1249,You rock Jenni. Great vid
1250,„Finishing on the hands is perfect as you would expect it from a Patek“ – well apparently not. Just watch the aquanaut video from watchfinder or the „whats the best sportswatch“ from watchfinder. Sometimes the finishing is almost abysmal for this pricepoint.
1251,"Real problem is availability of authentic one at retail price. At double the price, it starts to become watch snobbery."
1252,where can we buy this
1253,A Beautiful Lady who likes watches...❤️😍😘
1254,"2 questions . Does that mean the authentic ones are extremely overpriced ? Next , does the brand has a big part to play for the rise of replica (many people who are actually well off are buying replicas these days)"
1255,Can we have a link for the replica online store?
1256,Fake Patek Giveaway? Pretty please :)
1257,Incredible! I Want to buy this replica :-D
1258,"After seeing your video now I know... the right one is a fake one. You could I have it on the left... gosh, what am I saying?!"
1259,The closer look of the real one made me appreciate Patek more
1260,i saw ur nail..
1261,"I'm at 1:10, and at first glance the left one looks authentic and the right one doesn't. The bracelet is a tad bit narrower where it meets the case of the right hand side watch."
1262,Have to be rep fam to find a rep like this.
1263,"All I want to know is where can I buy the replica Patek? I've never been into replica watches, but this particular PP replica is actually really well made for its price and I'd rock the shit out of it"
1264,"Biggest fear here that it is very concerning is the winding mechanism being so accurate, this is generally the glaring tell  Unless you really know the watch or have a genuine accompanied by a loop then it’s going to be exceptionally difficult. The aesthetics will continue to improve so buying preowned will prove very risky ."
1265,"All I am thinking is, where the link for the replica?"
1266,"Thanks Jenni for ur informative video.  👌Outstaning effort...

🕕🕔🕓🕒🕑🕐🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🕛🕡🕠🕟🕞🕝🕜🕢🕣🕤🕥🕦🕧
I am wondering how many people - like me - would like u to share with us direct link for purchasing this ""500 euro"" [high-end Patek Philippe replica] - shown in ur video? 🤚😉"
1267,where can I buy the clone?
1268,Stop these kind of watch videos
1269,"The 'quality' of fake watches has improved significantly in recent times. Relative to the laughably cheap battery-powered garbage of the 1980s or 1990s they are certainly in a new league now. Nevertheless much that is being said about these so-called 'high-end' fakes is still greatly hyped-up and exaggerated, I find. Quite often this hype is coming from people with links to big dealers - who, of course, also have a vested interest in scaring potential buyers into paying a premium by buying only from well-known names. Be that as it may. If one looks carefully at a replica such as the one featured in this video (especially under magnification) the differences between it and the original are actually pretty obvious. For reasons of economy the fake-industry can't reproduce the same level of fine hand finishing as an original Patek - and it shows almost everywhere you look. To take the most glaring example: looking through the display case-back and making a direct fake-to-genuine comparison, anyone at all (even a child with zero experience of watchmaking) would simply have to notice the stark difference in quality between the real Patek caliber and the fake! Of course one would not normally be making a direct side-by-side comparison. But even so, it's hard to imagine that any sensible person could actually be fooled into buying a fake, thinking it to be real. Such a victim would have to be somebody who has never held a real Patek Philippe in the hand, and someone who knows absolutely nothing about high horology watches. Well okay, but how likely is it that such a person would be out there seeking to buy a genuine Patek in the first place?! In at least in 99.9% of cases these fakes are being bought by people who know exactly what they are getting, IMO. They buy them because they would like to have the genuine article but sadly can't afford it. I have little doubt that most of them feel sad and sick deep down inside every time they look at their fake. And most of them probably also have a real dread of being discovered and publicly humiliated whenever they find themselves near to someone who knows anything about watches."
1270,"Very good video, keep up the good work"
1271,Are EU people too lazy?
1272,What about counting the number of beatings in 10 seconds? I do not expect that a 500 euro replica will mount an high-beat movement.
1273,They eventually will improve this imperfections & only add extra $100/200 for those extra detailed.People still will buy it either they know or not. Probably in the next 5 years we cant tell the different anymore.They re getting closer.Scary
1274,😱
1275,"No body know which one is real yah fake patek phillippe nautilus, thanks for explained"
1276,These videos don’t help anyone except for the replica / clone makers will do better next version.  Soon will high end watches loose so much value if they don’t come up with something that guarantees its value..
1277,"Hell I want he replica!!!! Lots cheaper man, don’t be stupid🤪"
1278,"I have a €1,200 replica of this watch and the differences you highlight are either not there are as good as impossible to distinguish on mine. Even came with a 1 yr guarantee. All from a German guy in Dubai who sources the best possible"
1279,I need to buy this replica 😉
1280,No one looks at a watch with a microscope
1281,The one with the teal blue shadows on the dial.
1282,Where can I get that replica
1283,that meat if you want to compare it you should have the real one too..
1284,"I bought a fake Chanel 200 € in 2007, and he still works ! 
I show it to a watch saler he said he doesn't see the différent between a fake and a real."
1285,Does it have hacking seconds?
1286,One more thing about the movement - on the fake there is a regulator for the balance spring. On the original the balance is free sprung.
1287,I have a question is there any model of rolex or AP or PATEK without any milligram of gold so no gold not in the movment or hourmarkers if so can you sum them up the only high end option is omega i think they use rodium on the hour markers if im wrong can you help me thx👍👍
1288,where buy this clone watch ?
1289,PM me where to get the rep model babe
1290,But where is the link? Lmao
1291,Where do you buy those can u tell us i would like to buy one
1292,Ok where can I buy one...hha
1293,One is a 100 times more expensive. Should it be?
1294,Is it wierd that the new noob relica 5711a has all these Problemen reworked and they say they are the same now as the authentic😂
1295,"Those ""genuine vs fake"" watch videos are great!! They are showing everyone that they dont need to spend a fortune to own cool watches! Please, bring more cool fake watches! You are doing a great marketing for the counterfeit industry!"
1296,The protruded crown is the easiest tell
1297,Where we can get the replica
1298,Always look at the balance. Rolex and Patek use high-end free-sprung balance assemblies. The fakes always have a regulator or a beat corrector because there are no clone movements (yet) that I’ve seen made with free-sprung balances.
1299,I only buy from AD nothing more nothing less atleast  I have a Peace of mind that  I definitely owned a real piece.
1300,Where can I buy the replica?
1301,Where can i buy that perfect replica? Where‘s the link....
1302,"Stop glorifying this trash
thank you"
1303,Don’t be shocked. EU outsources watch making to other countries. They have parallel factories one for legit and one for fake. Your design is already leak out.
1304,"There are dust specs on the disk of the replica, something PP would never Let happen"
1305,Send me the link to purchase the replica watch
1306,Can you faked Zaratsu?
1307,I think the left one is right... due to the dial
1308,"At 3:20 and at 3:22 you’ve repeated yourself “we are going to talk about the movement in a minute” overall good review, thank you 🙏"
1309,"Thanks for sharing Jenni! Fake or not, this watch isn't pretty at all. It looks like they failed to make it round enough. Very odd."
1310,"Hi Jenni, great vid again, but please consider cleaning the watches better before you do super Macro shots, same goes for hand and fingernails shown in the vids. Maybe blasting the watches with compressed air after thoroughly cleaning them would help a lot."
1311,Where did you buy it? I want a Cartier santos.
1312,"Amazing fake worth the money,you save me a lot of money jaja"
1313,This only proves brand name watchmakers are making colossal profit margins
1314,"The worse is they could totally use another brand name on the dial and sell these as amazing homages... But they wouldn't sell as well as pure replicas because people just badly want to fake wealth, which is insanely sad when you think about it for a minute."
1315,The replica isn't free sprung. The rep has a regulator.
1316,should have talk a lot more about the bracelet differences
1317,"The real is not bad if you can afford it, the replicas are just for fashion and to tell time. No big deal!"
1318,"would people buy a $3000 fake PP if China make a real 1:1 ? if people would, I am sure china will even beat PP at it's own game"
1319,"I say this for all super replica, why not just make your own watch??? This fake is really well done, and if it were sold as a homage watch with it's own brand it would be a fantastic alternative. But because it's a fake it loses all credibility. They made a very beautiful watch that would be a perfect homage"
1320,Left is real
1321,"Can u tell me where can I buy the fake one,, an exact address would help please,,,"
1322,If u don't own an original high end watch it’s literally impossible to find out the difference 😁
1323,Channel reported to Archie Luxury..
1324,Same as handbags etc
1325,"I think fake version 2.0 will be better 
They will thank you for identifying the loop holes in the first version"
1326,Were you not a little bit afraid to mix up the replica and the real one and to put them in incorrect boxes?
1327,"Hi Jenni,
Your channel it’s one of the bests atm, thanks for that.
So as fakes goes you’re right, it’s being more and more difficult. But only because people tend to buy them more and more. Obviously everyone wants to own a PP or a Rolex, but not everyone is as lucky to be able to afford it. So here’s my suggestion, tell us from your experience what are the best watches people can buy from $600-1400. Seiko, Steinhart, Certina, Hamilton etc etc. I think is valid and educational to show these initial brands and way lower budgets that are actual the budget the “fake supporters” will pay for a watch, the advise will not put out the addicts that collect replicas like if they were the real deal, but it can help the people looking for a good watch with a very low budget. Cheers..."
1328,Imagine accidentally throwing away the authentic one instead of the fake
1329,the fake have two regulate arms in the balance bridge the real got only fine regulator
1330,Where can I buy the fake Patek Philippe?
1331,From Where do you get the fake???
1332,i have to agree on most things but claiming the workhorse Japanese miyota 8000 series movement is not really using it's jewels is plainly wrong and an insult to the almost legendary longevity this movement is capable off. #Justsaying :)
1333,why are you stealing videos original  video watchvice
1334,"So one is genuine PP being sold by a scalper at multiple of official price, probably in cahoots with an AD, the other one in a copy being sold at cheap watch price and everyone looking at PP for 500 bucks would know it is not genuine. I am not sure what is more fake here."
1335,I think the one on the left is real. The brushing looks better but  I'm not great with patek Philippe  watches better with spotting a fake rolex
1336,I have replica the same quality if not better. It has cost 60€. I bought 2 and sold the second for 120€ so it was basically for free :D Just had to pay to make the wristband smaller.
1337,"A pretty big givaway is also the bracelet fit. You can see that bracelet on a fake has some gap in width in comparison with the case (case is wider than the bracelet), while the real one is fit impeccably.
Also, I have no idea where they sourced the red jewels, it's the first time I see something like that. It looks off not only for a Patek Philippe, but also for any other mechanical watch."
1338,Where can we buy the fake?
1339,What about a timegrapher ? Would this be the easiest way to spot a fake ?
1340,"Replica on the right.  Crown is too exposed and the dial blue looks wrong, plus the bracelet just looks off for some reason"
1341,I’m pretty sure even a authorised dealer could possible make a mistake and sell a clone version ..
1342,Why would it shock you? Do you not realize these Swiss timepieces are so overpriced it's ridiculous.  That Nautilus probably cost Patek a couple grand to make.
1343,"Whilst I am hardly an expert in this field, what I believe happens is that the lathes / bar turning and CNC machines used by most of the big prestige names in watchmaking are broadly similar...and are also available to counterfeiters. Where the difference lies is in the skillset and the sheer number of hours put in to hand finish a watch - simply to iron out any imperfections in finish, the cut, the lines, the polish etc. That is in large part what you are paying for with a Patek Phillipe. It's a huge price to pay for authenticity, but one that many are willing to do..."
1344,"If you can fake a 60,000 euro watch that well for a fraction of the cost, it should make you pause and think about what you're buying and whether it's the watch that is valuable or the name."
1345,Ugly watch! I wouldn't pay $100 for it.
1346,"Authentic on the left looking at the screen. The crown is recessed on the real model. At this point, I'd be more impressed if you wore the fake, you saved yourself some money. If they threw a spring drive in the fake, would it be that much different than the original? On a serious note always buy the seller not the watch."
1347,"I want buy one fake, just because it's beautiful and cheap .I like the design"
1348,It's close enough.  I wouldn't be able to tell the difference nor would I buy a real one.  Hell... $500... I'll wear a fake!
1349,"In my opinion, A.P., Patek, Rolex, and Vacheron have made it so very difficult to purchase a watch from them; that unfortunately, people are forced to purchase from Resellers or Scalpers. I have never had that problem with A. Lange & Söhne or F.P. Journe; they have the nicest boutique staff, very welcoming. They don't act like you have to be a V.I.P client to purchase one of their watches. A.P. boutiques, especially, will let you know ""Sorry we can't sell this, can't even put your name down on a waiting list. Not possible"". Hence why something like the Royal Oak Open Work will jump from $50K to $100K; impossible."
1350,Ich lache mich gerade schlapp 😹. Da macht die Jenni seit 4 Monaten Uhren-Youtube und zieht mal eben deutlich an allen deutschen Kanälen vorbei. Da dürfte selbst ihr Mann überrascht sein :-)
1351,Jenni which website sells the fake watch? Warn us for this website please. So that we never buy accidentally this fake watch on that website.
1352,"right one is fake.
the crown is sticking out too far and the datewheel is bad"
1353,I wear that Fake Patek anytime.
1354,fake‘s crown sticks out too much. took one second to catch the “super replica“ ...
1355,"I would wear the replica ... No issues , no shame."
1356,Geez this type of fakes scares the crap out of me!
1357,"Difference....99% of the population won't know it's a replica, 90% of the population dont even know what a Patek Philippe is or it's going price."
1358,We would like to see the differences between a real & fake Audemars
1359,"China should be held accountable for everything. They steal and copy, it's not right."
1360,left is real and right it fake
1361,"You're impressed with the fake rep Jenny . However although  the Nautilus reps are popular with replica collectors ( yes they exist ) they are aware of the flaws themselves and put up with them. There are much ' better ' replicated watches made in different luxury brands , of course these still have flaws ( often very hard to find without the genuine watch to compare ,being very OCD, a loupe , and an expert on reps/gen without opening up the case    ) . The Nautilus is always going to be easy to tell due to the open case back ! No way they are going to replicate the finishing on a gen PP . You missed one easy tell on the watch the PP logo on the rotor is laser etched on the gen it is engraved . Also I don't  think that is the ' best ' Nautilus rep you can buy at $500 it looks like the second best . The movement looks like a modified Miyota 9015 with decorated bridges, plates etc hence the rattle ( Miyota's have unidirectional  wind) . The best version is $600 and has a 324 clone movement of the PP genuine . It also dresses some of the flaws you point out such as the crown height . Also buy the white dial version the faker's have that spot on 😂"
1362,I still cannot believe that it is a fake it will be getting scarrier to buy from gray market in the future
1363,"I'll never have to worry about buying a fake 60 or 80 thousand dollar watch, since there is no way, I could justify, spending that kind of money on a watch, even Bill Gates wears a 45 dollar Casio. Stainless steel is not very rare."
1364,I think the one on the right is a fake.
1365,The real watch is overrated while the fake is underrated
1366,"That's why only buy skeletonized watches they are much harder to fake. eg. AP Millenary, RMille, Arnold&Sons. The only remaining semi/covered dials that currently cant be faked are Lange1s and Freaks. Panerais Rolexes Pateks etc can all be replicated easily in China with miyota/eta movement lol."
1367,ok there is one think that fake watches have not done anything about it and that's the thickness of the case. If they use a thinner movement and work on that colour of the dial noooobody can notice if it's fake
1368,Where can you buy these top-end watches please
1369,"£500 fake watch , I can only afford a Seiko automatic at half that price , but I'm happy with it though . Anyway those watches both look the same to me , and anyway spending that much money  is far too silly for a watch ."
1370,Where can I get the best replica like this?
1371,Might get hate for this but I own a $700 Roger Dubuis Excalibur replica. Not ashamed to say it. I absolutely love it. Even if I had the money to afford a genuine I don’t think I’d buy it. After seeing the quality of the replicas I just can’t justify spending the money on a genuine. Unless it’s a FREAK.
1372,The authentic one actually steals from u more than the fake
1373,the Chinese should just make their own designs and original unique movements they make all this effort to make fakes they can easily put the the Swiss to shame the Swiss are living on borrowed time very little justifies paying $30K for a Stainless steel Daytona when the   Chinese could make an exact copy for no more than $3K if they wanted to only the serial numbers would give it away ..
1374,"Nice video Jenni, there is a hacker quote that says whatever a human mind makes another can copy it. There is no way I can see this Patek Philippe Nautilus is fake without a real watch to compare it. I f the Chinese counterfeiter had invested a $1000 more they could have got this fake 90 % real. It is a lucrative scam because the Patek Philippe Nautilus cost up to $100,000 in the second hand US market. To avoid scam there is a saying that says buy the dealer, not the watch."
1375,Link to buy the fake one plz
1376,I prefer the replica because of the better cost x benefit.
1377,"This shows how much of the price is simply there to make the watch too expensive for the poor. Meaning you aren't buying a good watch, you;re buying a wealth status signifier."
1378,"A watch with Geneva seal is easy to spot the difference between real and fake by the movement alone, the fake one can never reproduce the same level of finish."
1379,this is not a high end replica I recon. Chinese PPF finishing is better this piece. 200-300 euro will be enough.
1380,This only shows how overestimated luxury watches are.
1381,"Don't say replica, it's fake and there is huge difference between those two things."
1382,"Anyone who buys a 50K watch to impress others is going to fail all day long.  You buy it because you love watches, want to own something exclusive that will appreciate in value ...would rather invest in something that you can wear that goes up in value rather than a stock or bond that will sit in a safe and likely not do as well as a Daytona or Nautilus will.   You buy a fake and it doesn't impress folks (they have no clue what a Nautilus is) and you know that you are wearing a fake so it's like hanging a fake Picasso in your study and trying to fool people.  Really?  Why bother?"
1383,"Seeing this makes wonder how they can fetch such high prices for their watches. The replica is quite lovely, though I hate that purple dial!"
1384,The reason it's such a popular choice to replicate is because for what it costs you're not getting a lot so making fakes is more profitable and easy. It's a time only automatic in steel. Sure finishing is great but at the price that's the least you could ask for. Nobody would try to replicate a datograph because of the difficulty in making them. It's almost like the fakers are telling us which watches are hype and which ones are worth their price.
1385,Guys dont kidding yourself. The fake is really good. Nobody absolutely nobody will look so close at your clock to see if its original or not. But if you want to know for yourself that its original or not than its OK to look so close and find the mistakes.
1386,"I don't want to ruin the good video, but posting it to consult someone that is willing to pay 60k EURO for a watch is a joke. (How many of the 800k viewers can afford that at all?) This particular person would not care about any videos if they're willing to pay the full price. They will go to a retail store and buy right away with respective guarantee and will not try to save 1-2k buying it from someone at the street.. And if somebody  thinks that 500 Euro for a PATEK or 600 USD for Rolex is adequate and buys the watch.. then i'm really sorry to say it, but they are plain stupid."
1387,"In my opinion, buying real or replica is depending on personal preference.  People who can afford to buy this kind of high-end watch and accept its value for quality and investment purpose, that’s fine.  If putting replica and be able to joke about it with other people, that’s fine too.  If putting on replica to impress other people, I would not do that because replica is replica (Fake) not real.  For myself, I like to be real myself with other people by putting real affordable watch.  That’s why I have Seiko, Orient, Citizen, Universal, Casio watches to enjoy with my different daily activities like clothing fashion."
1388,I wouldn't give a you £60 for any of them both horrible looking  watches
1389,Replica value is actual money wer proper value is lablled not original
1390,"I would buy the fake over real anytime, simply because 95% of the people cant afford a real one like me."
1391,If replicas are getting better and better than shouldn't we just buy a replica and save money!
1392,Original left. Fake right.
1393,My Spongebob watch is better
1394,"Patek Philippe is making me laugh, i wouldn't change with my (Seiko Astron GPS sse041j )"
1395,"My advice is buy only what you can afford as out there are no cheaper opportunities. How many people are winning jackpot in a multimillion lottery in one year? Handful only,  and that out of tens or even hundreds of million loosers. If you want something than buy from verified official dealer no matter what is the price. Only idiots believe that hopes become true. Live as your pocket allow you and not one iota more."
1396,Where can we find a good replica like this ?
1397,Left authentic. Right fake. Dial color
1398,"they sale the fake as fake. So if there are tiny difference, nobody care."
1399,"I always wanted to do this. One day, I'm going to make a watch called ""Ammonites""."
1400,"You should do voice acting for cockpit voice information systems. ""Let's get staaaaated!"" lol!"
1401,3:21 Jenni editing error?
1402,"Excellent video is always, amazing how close these are, But I cant bring myself to buy a fake, I will never afford a real one but still nice to look and as alwasys great info in the video!!!  Hi Jenni, Check your export edited file there is a double replay of video/audio at 3min 20sec just FYI"
1403,"if the rep is so good, try handing it back & keep the real one..  :)"
1404,"Not knowing much or having ever seen one, I think the left is real since the crown is tucked further into the guards."
1405,"Thank you, Jenni, another awesome video. I look forward to the next one."
1406,Another great one Jenni! 🤙🏻
1407,"Out of the 15k views, about 1500 are dying to ask where you can get one.
On certain other vlogs that number would rise to about 14k.
What I don't get is the point of this comparison. Doesn't do PP any favours to reveal that you need a loupe to tell the difference."
1408,Outstanding video. Thank you!
1409,the only authentic: Beautiful Annie
1410,"What level of magnification do you use for your macro shots? Looking to buy a magnifying glass or a loupe but unsure of which one to get. 
Just one recommendation/request. Maybe make these real vs fake videos after a full video/review of the original watch. Hoping to see a full video on the Nautilus from ya!"
1411,once I saw a clone of double the price of the video we took it with several watchmakers and none said it was clone
1412,"Love your channel! 
Can you do a similar video with the omega aqua terra??"
1413,Wow. Thanks for the great comparison. Another brilliant video.
1414,You are the best watch reviewer on YouTube 👍
1415,Came from today’s live!
1416,"say 'definitely' one more time, I dare you"
1417,just look at the finish of the hands and the escapement wheel.
1418,I love your voice! Your English is beautiful ❤️.
1419,"Hi Jenni, I think you should update the Instagram photo inviting people to follow you with your current number of posts and followers.
Thinking you only have 3 posts might not draw people in like it should.
Thanks for the content, keep it coming."
1420,"1:04
Fake on the right. The lateral edge of the integrated bracelet does not quite meet the lateral edge of the case."
1421,Please make a video highlighting the incrongruencies between an authentic and replica F-91W.
1422,"Great review Jenni.  However, look at the smudge on the minute hand on the real watch at 4:40 - 4:43.  Far from perfection I'd suggest."
1423,BB58 comparison would be lovely! Thanks 👌
1424,"These fakes have gotten scary good. Take a Rolex Explorer or similarly simple watch, it would be very hard to tell them already especially with full clone movements. Great video as always."
1425,"Wouldnt buying the real one be the 60,000 Euro mistake?"
1426,"Jenni love to see your videos! I joined your channel when you had only 2 vids up and was super impressed with the attention to detail and quality! IMO there’s a place for replica watches just like there’s is a place for replica cars, especially for someone like me who’s 25 and will likely never see one of these watches outside of a storefront window, it gives us a chance to experience a taste of the design. And honestly if you COULD afford a watch like this wouldn’t you be worried about wear and tear, I mean stainless is pretty soft especially with how incredibly fine the brushing on the watch is. I feel like as long as you don’t pass the replica off as anything but a replica, who cares? Even if you don’t have these side by side and the one you’re holding is a fake, you should really know what you’re doing before dropping 60k on a watch. Kind of obvious in this example. Although I understand where it would be much harder with less expensive watches like Rolex or omega."
1427,Great Video Jenni try to get hold of the new Submariner date its unbelievably a 1:1 clone.
1428,thank you for such detailed video; at the same time it's a bit disheartening to see how these replica watches just get so good
1429,Great lesson
1430,What's Shocking the real one..lol
1431,"Honestly, even with your tips... there's no way I'll be able to spot a superfake"
1432,Nice video ! which lens are you using for those hyperclose shots?
1433,Can somebody make me a fake Ferrari or Lambo to go with that fake PP? I’ll pay full Camry sticker price for it! Thanks!
1434,"Great video Jenni, very informative 👍👌😊"
1435,Left?
1436,Nice review Jenni....
1437,How much do they charge you for the bought/fake subscribers?
1438,How many definitely's???
1439,on the left is real?
1440,"You forgot to include the link for buying the fake. 😉
Actually in 5 years time it will probably be virtually impossible to tell the difference if these replicas keep improving at the rate they are doing so at the moment. Crazy"
1441,link for the replica?
1442,Looks to me like the left one is the real one! But damn it’s impossible to tell if someone is wearing it on their wrist and moving.
1443,Horology House gonna start selling 5711 knockoffs soon.
1444,No matter how rich I get. It's a Casio that will be on my wrist
1445,Finally i can clout chase on social media without having to spend $60k euro.
1446,Holy crap that's scary.😬
1447,I cant even buy a fake Patek :D
1448,What do you think about Braun?
1449,Am I the only one that cant even afford the replica?
1450,But you will always know.
1451,Hey I've been living in Bangkok for 5 years now and year on year the fakes here get better and for under 50$ never mind 500$......I think because of all the great fakes in the market  the only way to buy second hard watches is  at ADs or companys that have been around for years with great views .....them good old days on buying off YouTube is now too risky. .again great video jennie........I would love to hear your top 5  luxury watches with the best lume !!!!
1452,"Hey Jenni, where did youg et the replica? I want to get it to compare it to my original. Thanks for all the great videos!"
1453,Authentic on the left?
1454,"#8. Many 5711 replicas also have adjustable bracelet links held together with screws instead of pins, which is ironically an upgrade."
1455,Incredibile dove sono arrivati adesso!
1456,"Jenni Jenni, who can I turn to?"
1457,"I have tried to obtain a bad replica of a Rolex for some time, to make an article on my FB and instagram page.
But it's easier to get AAA or better fakes, than a Sh..ty fake.
It's getting harder and harder, to be a watch collector, trading on line.
Great video. :-)"
1458,It’s a shame some of these rip off brands don’t take their skills and just make a high quality 500 dollar watch. The finishing on the watch is actually good.
1459,"This is the only watch I love that I probably will never justify purchasing due to its price, making it the only watch I consider buying a replica of."
1460,How do I get a replica?
1461,"The clones are getting better and better, wonder when they will get objectively better than the original"
1462,What about the box? Pretty sure the real one is as expensive as the replica.
1463,wow that's disturbing impressive .-.
1464,"For this particular replica, the crown isn't as flush with the case as the real."
1465,Progression of the superfakes combined with the Horology House debacle has pretty much ended 'buy the seller' for collector to collector sales.
1466,"what if someone buys this , then buy real patek minute hand. Put it on the watch, how can you tell then?"
1467,I want that replica !
1468,Replica looks very fake 😂
1469,But neither say bagelsport on the dial
1470,Does the fake keep time as the real one ?
1471,It’d be really interesting to see a Panerai super clone vs the real one. It’s been known on the replica market that certain PAM models are so indistinguishable that they’re deemed NWBIG (not worth buying in gen). That’ll be an cool comparison to see!
1472,i think the left one is real
1473,"In terms of design, the nautilus is fairly easy to replicate with inferior materials."
1474,"60,000 euros for the Patek, an old design, it's preposterous.  Grossly overpriced by every measure."
1475,Where I can buy that replica :)
1476,I hope soon people who can produce such things at such prices will find great partners to launch authentic brands. Kudos to their craftsmanship.
1477,Scary
1478,"Bring a strong loupe I guess.   On the fake, the bracelet has a rougher edge between links visible when you were asking us to pick which is which.  You are right, the finishing of the hands is probably the best place to look (for now)."
1479,Manicure....Just saying
1480,"Very good video, Jenni. I have had several fakes and have moved to genuine pieces myself, but am familiar with a lot of this information having been an active member on the replica forums for many years. I am sure that there are some tells in the bracelet as well, if you care to look."
1481,"59500€ more, i pit the people who own the gen watch."
1482,"Hi Jenni, have you ever heard the saying ""never ask a question you already do not know the answer to?"" Well, who makes most of these fakes? I thought so. The solution is, countries that elect their leaders should only have diplomatic relations with the same. No exceptions. How much money is being lost here, out of control?"
1483,left authentic
1484,500 euro is still expensive
1485,"@4:40, the hands definitely have grime on them. That would be unacceptable if I were to spend that much on a watch!"
1486,Dare I ask where to buy a replica watch of this quality?
1487,The one on the left is real....I think!
1488,"Left one, is authentic"
1489,Enchanting.
1490,Were can I get the fake one from
1491,Its so easy to clone a Patek Nautilus
1492,You wouldn’t be able to tell the difference if you don’t have a reference model !
1493,".. macht ihr beiden nun identische Videos? Einmal englisch, einmal deutsch? 🧐"
1494,"The free sprung balance is clearly visible in the real Nautilus and missing in the fake. Also, the hairspring in the fake does not have the Breguet overcoil. These are the most obvious differences and you should have mentioned them. Instead you talked forever about minor cosmetic differences. Why?"
1495,So did you just use someone else's video and not made your own.
1496,"I really like your videos. These type, showing us the fake vs real, are spectacular. I want you to know that first. I have just found your channel and even though I will never ever be able to afford even a $6000 Rolex, I will continue to watch your channel and enjoy the knowledge you have about all of these spectacular pieces of art that are worn on a wrist and tell you the time as a bonus."
1497,replicas is getting so damn close that it's disgusting.
1498,I do not like replica watches and would never buy one. But I’m askin myself if the difference is really worth about 59.500 EUR 🤔
1499,"I'm surprised that the sides of the hands on the authentic watch still have the striations from being stamped out, You would think on a watch that expensive they would have polished them out."
1500,It is just as well that A)I don't like the design and B)I couldn't afford either of them...............
1501,Why do you keep make video like this? you just give them visibility...a paid advertise?
1502,The one on the left is the real one.
1503,Isn't it shameful to wear a 60k watch while 700 million people live on under $2 per day
1504,YAY bye-bye Urban Gentry!! Someone give Urban Gentry the fake nautilus because Tristano is fake as hell and only wants the cool stuff because he doesn't know much about watches hence why he promotes Squale. Keep exposing anything fake Jenni
1505,Left = Real / Right = Fake
1506,"The lettering  revealled the fake one. But it is incredible how fake watches are getting better and better....dangerous place to be in ... the dark side of horologyi! Great video, Jenni!"
1507,the crown is such a dead giveaway and I haven't even clicked play on the video.
1508,"Here is a description from the site where this fake model is being sold ($498.00). I quote in full, but without photos. By the way, the photos of the mechanism of the fake instance completely coincide with your video: 
""NAUTILUS JUMBO 5711 SUPER REPLICATION PPF V3 1:1 BEST EDITION GRAY TEXTURED DIAL ON SS BRACELET PPF324"
1509,so where can i get a good super fake like this one??
1510,"If you buy watches for others, the fake one is a very god choice 
If you buy watches for yourself, original watches is the way to go"
1511,"Now that you have said it out, the next ten replicas will have better finished hands lol. If the replica manufacturers who make this good watches cube up with an original design and sell it, I’m sure people would buy it. I would rather sport a decent original watch from an obscure brand than a replica."
1512,Scary how fakes have improved 😬
1513,Five hundred euros for the fake? I'd better start saving.
1514,You’re not a YouTube channel unless you do a fake vs real watch video. Congratulations you passed.
1515,Meh. Nobody really cares. You ask most people what movements their watch posses and they don't know. Ask for the time and they will give you the right time. So who cares?  Buy from an authentic dealer and that is it.
1516,These videos just encourage people to buy fakes....
1517,How many people can tell when its on someone's wrist?
1518,"That’s not even one of the best fakes out there, there are 5711s available that are the exact same thickness and most of those tells you’ve shown are not applicable. Real Pateks are beautiful but no where near the valuation they charge they’re a nice 8-9k watch which is what they should be sold for."
1519,I thought the left one was fake.
1520,"The real question is, if Chinese fake manufacturers are capable of creating this level of quality, why not put that to work in their own brand?"
1521,"It's an ugly, cheesy watch, authentic or not."
1522,"The funny things is that there is more fake 5711 out there than the real ones. Also consider this, if someone could make a fake Nautilus that is in such good quality for 500 euros, What has Patek been doing for 25000 eruo?"
1523,A counterfeit is not a replica.
1524,I think the right one was the fake
1525,Trying to understand the purpose of this video. Glorifying this insidious trade isn't cool. Counterfeiters should be locked up and buyers need to look in the mirror and reevaluate their life.
1526,"Its quite easy to see the difference between the 2020 Patek movement and the 2020 Replica, there is a feather like wheel with tiny branches in the Patek that looks like its nano engineered with advanced manufacturing processes. Doubt any replica can produce it at a profitable price."
1527,It’s good that you do fakes videos.  They are  getting better.  I use ADs or go through someone I know.  Buying on eBay must be scary (I don’t think I could do it).  Good video.
1528,"Why are these people giving air time to illegal, copyright infringing replicas?"
1529,A friend of a friend asked where the fake one is available...
1530,The one on the Right is fake. Hope im right.
1531,Why do you say “replica” when the correct term is “counterfeit”?
1532,The one on the right is fake
1533,"Still wishing you’d do some videos on some $1,000-2000 watches if you like any brands and models in this range or have in the past."
1534,"I'm surprised that watch experts are""surprised"" at the accuracy of these reps.  They've been very accurate for 15 years that I know of"
1535,"It seems like the people who made the fake have the resources to make a decent watch, why not just make it unique and sell if for €500?"
1536,Where do people buy those fakes? Online or when they travel to asia?
1537,The crown guard on the fake is way too short...
1538,I want that replica !
1539,Great channel Jenni but less 'real vs fake' videos please. They are the most boring and least relevant type of videos watch channels put out. More reviews or watch commentary videos please!
1540,Plot Twist : It was a Fake Jenni doing the video today.
1541,in your left had is authentic in your right hand is a fake.
1542,"I would never ever buy or even accept from somebody a fake anything.. but let’s be serious for a second here.. how are they creating a fake to such a high high degree for such a low low price?? Then somehow, the real watch’s $60K price is justified????"
1543,The way the world was going at the moment  I would  be happy to pay €600 for the fake  that omg €60.000   i know people  r not going to like what I said    you get one life so live it  at his moment in the world
1544,"60.000€ for what!?
While there are sheep there will be wool..."
1545,"Don't like either watches real or fake. Don't know why people are drooling over these. A Chopard watch is way more beautiful, or simple Rolex date just gold and steel."
1546,China has faked everything superbly except humans. They didn't replicate that....yet.
1547,"the original one is over price, definitely not worthy to buy 👎"
1548,Can't wait for the day that these luxury brands go out of business by clones. No excuse for a watch to cost more than $1000 unless it can save your life.
1549,"I got deep into high-end replicas for a few years, and I must say - the replica world and the people that converse on the forums are more real and authentic than the ""real watch"" community IMO. The guys I imported from gave better service than my AD too. That being said - I could easily afford just about any watch at that time (because I wasn't dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on watches, to begin with). I invested that money in Tesla, and well - things worked out. I have purchased several real high-end watches since (Ressence and others), and to be honest, I have several replicas that I prefer over my high-end watches. "
1550,"Left is Patek, Right is the clone. Thick bezel and crown position, pokes out a tiny little bit more are the main two tells from looking at it. A more interesting thing to comment on replicas is... when the little Chinese backstreet factories get it so close, why are Patek charging so much? The better the reps get, the more I realise what a con the luxury watch market is... I'm not endorsing reps and I own the authentic, genuine models... but they're starting to get so good that you have to ask yourself... is it really worth wearing the genuine article?"
1551,"I own an older model Rolex Air King and an Omega Seamaster. Both watches show some sign of passage of time, small marks, dings, hairlines etc. It will not be possible to spot a fake on a second hand market, without a close inspection by an experienced watchmaker. And even then, considering the better and better quality of the replicas, it's going to be tough. "
1552,The fakes getting this good just makes you realise how ridiculous the price of the originals really is..... If some one can copy it this closely for such a huge amount less Patek could sell for significantly less. Their margin must be astronomically gigantic!
1553,Where did you get that replica
1554,"I’d rather wait, work my ass off and get the real thing."
1555,"der größte Unterschied: Die Fake Uhr ist ihr Geld wert, die echte ist gut 55.000€uro zu Teuer....."
1556,$ 60.000 Price tag for the real one vs Fake $ 500 you are only paying for the status is it worth it  ? Craftsmanship % 99.9 identical labor cost and design we can add X 3 o X4 original one should go retail around $ 1500 - $ 2000 vs $ 60.000
1557,"I mean, $500 for a fake watch probably isn't all that bad."
1558,Fake looks better IMO. Buy the fake and a Tesla model 3
1559,How do you know the real is not fake. Or the fake is real. It's just words..
1560,"Plot Twist, the $500 ""fake"" is in fact made by the same company to get some of that low-end cash.... let's be serious here just how many people do you think are buying watches above $10k ?? $25k?? $30k?? .... 

the more expensive the object the smaller the market and the longer it takes to move product... and no succesful business can stay afloat without a steady CASH FLOW.. high end margins are great but their cash flows are TERRIBLE.. just look at the biggest companies in the world, they ALL sell cheap or render free services... why?? CASH FLOW... watches that are $10k + are ""prestigious"" but terrible for business.."
1561,Shame on you for promoting these fakes. Some people won't care about the  details and will be encouraged to purchase one after watching this. This is clearly all about clicks for you.  You claim to be an enthusiast but are content to damage the watch industry for your own selfish gain. I have forwarded this video to Pateks marketing department for comment
1562,i would say the one on the right is fake but a very good fake.
1563,The question is if the replicas are so good and cost a fraction of the cost why are the genuine ones so expensive the answer is your paying for the name
1564,No matter how original automatic your watch is rotor sucks evertytime
1565,Clearly right is fake the color is purple.
1566,"There is wrong call to fake watch as replica!!!!! Fake is fake, just check which means ""replica"" (a replica is a watch produced by the same company at a later date)"
1567,"The best way to detect it is not the watch. If you have a Patek, but don't have a yacht, a private plane, an expensive car, and you're dressed at Wallmart, I don't need to look closely at your wrist..."
1568,10 years time all the fakers will be better the all  real ones
1569,Plot twist: they are both fakes
1570,the fake isn't that great of a fake. The crown is way too big and the dial color is way off. Just the crown part alone can tell you definitely if the watch you hold is fake or not(can't determine the authenticity tho just if it's fake or not) said this before she even said anything
1571,With the money you save with the replica you could get a manicure ;P
1572,"Suddenly, hundreds of blokes who thought they made a killer deal buying a  Nautilus online for €38 k are sweating heavily 😂"
1573,"Jenni Elle : Don't buy fake watches guys! I hate fake watches and people who buys them!

Jenni Elle buys replica
Jenni Elle using fake watches as the main core of her content."
1574,Left is real and right is fake.
1575,"So the ""fake"" watch is not bad in quality but just different slightly."
1576,Fake watches for fake people
1577,"all that matters with me is the movment, if the replica has the same one, ill buy the replca"
1578,"I was wrong.  There are web sites that openly sell fake watches.  Why don't the major makers shut them down?  International law would be on their side.  Since you do quite a few videos on telling the difference between a fake vs real watches,  a video about legally stopping fake watches selling online would be very interesting."
1579,Time to go on r/reptime and find where to buy. Thanks for the vid!😁😁
1580,The fake is on the left. It is full of hate and wants to destroy our society.
1581,right is authentic left is fake
1582,Dont know if im the only one but i think there's a sound issue on your video. Have to turn up the volume at max to hear you
1583,the crown is too big. easy fake
1584,I Definetely don't need a magnifying glass to see that you urgently need a manicure....
1585,The fake is worth the money is the sad truth by a landslide
1586,the fake one looks more sophisticated
1587,Top 7 tips for making the super fakes even better! Well done!
1588,"right fake, can't see why you would want either. One is counterfeit the other is immoral."
1589,"It almost begs the question - 'Is buying the 60,000 euro one the real mistake when such a convincing alternative is available for a mere 500?'"
1590,Where can you buy the fake one at?
1591,"If it’s 500 euro, you might as well buy a genuine seiko or citizen. People who used to wear fakes all tell you they were usually constantly worried about someone pointing out it’s fake. Better to wear a genuine less expensive watch, than pretend to be someone you’re not. Love yourself no matter how much you got in the bank, and buy something that you enjoy, not something you think will impressive others."
1592,"Wen you you talking about watches, and this German accent OMG you are goddamm sexy 😊😊"
1593,Fake watches are for fake people
1594,Please share the link to buy the fake. So we don't go to the wrong shop
1595,The biggest tell is that the fake is only 500 euros.
1596,"You make buying a real one sounds like 60,000 euro mistake."
1597,I would  buy the fake any day If I only knew where to get them from
1598,"Right is fake ,crownguard is too short ,crown sticks out to much ,most obvious and easy to spot"

30,You’re forgetting that travel in 1918 took forever to get anywhere. COVID-19 spread so fast because of all of the airplanes taking it to every corner of the world within 2 weeks.
31,When we finally get out of quarentine is going to be like the avengers when they came back 5 year jump
32,So the media lied to everyone back then too eh?

260,ah i  if they had plans to land on mars i would definetly participate.
261,Am I the only one that doesn’t mind staying at home all day. We all cried about not going school now we don’t have too and that’s how I got into anime and art I also finished 3 books and my dad used this time to fix my laptop. I don’t mind being in a lockdown. The only problem is that I haven’t seen my friends in a long time.
262,"According to the CDC in June 2020, COVID-19 has a CFR ~0.5%"
263,"Case-fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in other influenza pandemics.

covid has a death rate of 0.23%."
264,0:50 this is relatively nitpicky but it really annoyed me the black plague is not a coronavirus as demonstrated in that picture it is a bacteria
265,Also remember most died from doctors prescribing an overdose of medication and it's believed the Spanish flu deaths were greatly exaggerated.
266,"Wow, April 46k deaths, almost 3 months later 573k deaths..."
267,Well that escalated quickly.

276,"This is comparing apples with grapefruit. 1918 was influenza, which died out as a deadly disease by replication errors.
2020 is a coronavirus which is highly unlikely to follow the same path. It has much better replication."

302,When this fancy modern world thought it controlled everything and a new virus reminded us that we DONT. And we never will.
303,It lasted almost as long as my addition to video games and cold cereal for dinner.
304,Some have likened this challenge to a war like WWII ... that lasted five years... we are only six months in.
305,I'd love to hear a follow up about what may happen with the addition of the Black Plague reemerging here in the states from Colorado squirrels. Perhaps the two viruses could potentially mutate and create something even worse.
306,Herd immunity & vaccinations.  Let’s get on with it.
307,"9:17 ""global tourism industry""

308,Well I am glad that medicine is not the same as 1918 anymore ... it is like comparing a half-dead donkey with only 1 leg and blind and old aged to a Enterprise E as means of transportation!
309,The fact I saw animal crossing
310,Can we also point out that medical technology at that point was barely a step above blood letting?
311,just watched this for the first time and made me want to check the covid stats. the fact that China is and has been reporting 0 cases for months is just. IDK how to describe it. how can the country with the highest population go from 40k cases a day to 0 within a month while the rest of the world has gone to poo? cant wait for the upcoming invasion. :/
312,"the biggest mistake humans make when facing a new virus, is thinking they Know too much. the poor response to Covid19 at the start came from us thinking the new Covid19 virus is the same as SARS, and we assume it will only spread after developing fever and only check for temperature at checkpoints. it took weeks to learn that the new virus can spread before symptoms show up. too much false information is also deadly like some world leaders were calling Covid19 as a virus that will go away like a miracle in April."
313,"its always about trust, which is why first response is so important, and why America dropped the ball again."

335,What is the one way to end Covid-19 earlier?

344,Don’t put the people you love at risk of becoming a statistic <3
345,this is nothing like 1918 virus and the virus only lasted 18 months mite of had some cases
346,"Is it even known that the different waves were the same virus, that it ""mutated in a deadlier strain""? They didn't have DNA sequencing back then, was there some sort of modern historical-forensics of some sort of sample that somehow preserved such strains, so that they could see there was a deadlier strain? AFAIK most of the deaths are attributed not to the virus itself, but to bacterial infection happening at the same time. That may also have been the main cause of difference in mortality between the supposed ""waves"" of the same virus, a different pathogen that didn't overlap as much in its outbreak with what's inferred to have been the first wave. Among other potential factors that influence lethality with essentially the same virus/strain."
347,"In 1918 they knew germs. But they had no idea about viruses. It was ""something new"" the scientists to took up the fight"
348,"Mmm, Funny, We are still in quarantine"
349,HIGHLY doubt China's rate is that low. 10's of Thousands of urns being shipped there say otherwise.

406,"This is why I always say at the start of a year, “This is not my year but working with others, I can try to put it toward me”. This always apply. If there is a new virus, others probably will try to downplay it. People are lazy according to Zipf’s law of least effort, they will try to spend the least effort(e = tw/tt +/- 0.1s, where tw = work time, tt= wake time, s=stress) and not do anything because it causes them to go out of their way. Thus, it’s probably going to be the virus’s year."

517,all this is just done because we have a limit to how many people we can look after at once in a hospital setting.. do we have examples where we managed to stop the common flu? no? maybe thats a thing.. most of us will get this.. just hope the hospital isnt full when that happens
518,So lucky to live in one of the COVID free states in Australia...and fingers crossed it will stay that way and the entire country will get it under control again.
519,"People in 1918 were just trialled by the Great War. They were battle hardened, disciplined, selfless, not much educated than us but reasonable, willing to do things for altruistic purpose even it violated their personal beliefs or interests, which are rare traits among us these days"
520,"we have a more robust health care system....for the privileged. The poor and minorities don't always have access to better health care.
Since the making of this movie, 100,000 more Americans have died. We have a loooong way to go ."
521,And here we are 2020 the same thing.....
522,On a bright note stistics world wide shows at this rate covid will completely obliterated influenza and flu right out existence in the next year.
523,Fun fact: US president Woodrow Wilson got the Spanish flu when negotiating the future of Germany after WW1
524,I swear future parents that was born in 2000’s are going to be the best parent
525,I love how the water bear just adorably floating in the aquarium in the back
526,"That was 1918! The technology nowadays that  is far more modern that then, I believe the Corona will end before 3 years. This movie will end soon...we will eventually see the light at the end of the tunnel!"
527,"more fear mongering, this cannot compare in anyway shape or form"
528,Vaccine in 2021 (:
529,You should do a follow-up video to this
530,9:36 DID BREW JUST DUPLICATED THE COFFEE JAR THINGIE!!!?!?
531,All of these pandemics come from Asia.   What started in Kansas came from Asia.
532,apparently covid-19 has 98% recovery rate
533,ok who leaked my photos in this video?
534,Might wanna update that cfr on coronavirus. At or below 1% currently
535,Brew just brewed up some more realness. Stay Safe people
536,@3:30 you mock Christians but more importantly you mock Christ.   Not appreciated.
537,this is 4 months ago guys they didn't know about the vaccine
538,6 months have passed.... what have we learned?
539,Isn't that century old data incomplete? I'm pretty sure they were testing way less people in 1918
540,"Change the current testing process.
Testers us the same glove they use to put into everyone’s mouth.  This alone will cause it to spread."
541,1918 is very different from 2020. If you exercise strong resolve everybody you can end it by the end of the year. You can do it everybody. Break the human link as long as you can the virus will end within months
542,just smite me now oh great lord above
543,"What kind of black magic ist this, he takes the coffee can but instead of removing it from the coffee machine it duplicates"
544,I don't want to suffer 2 more years man
545,"Spanish flu....hmmm.....that one also ""came from nowhere"" in conjunction when introducing a new radar during the war....just as ""Covid-19"" came along at the same time as 5G being implemented....."
546,As of today 29/July/20 151K+ dead of covid19
547,Nice rn it’s even higher
548,😂😂😂 what a joke.
549,A-am I the only one that thinks the intro was so dark and sad?? I-
550,"Be ready for the long haul.  It will take a vaccine.  Else, it will take a complete lockdown, which in the US is unlikely, or herd immunity which may result in 5 million US deaths at the current rate,  or we will continue to stagger along taking the current half measures which will slowly result in herd immunity, but could take five years or more."
551,You should do an update!
552,"so people who get the covid-19, if it is anything like the other disease, could lose all immune response to a covid-20 or covid-21? Even more reason to avoid it."
553,Seriously pisses me off that in 2020 we weren’t able to swiftly contain covid at the start when we know about our history. The fact that people are too mentally fragile to take a virus seriously is astounding.
554,Well we have more advanced technology then they did so this might end faster
555,I agree what why the video says the last. It is not the time to blame. Do your part!!!
556,We are all one Community and shifting blame does nothing to protect ourselves or the people we love!  We just have to do our part!!
557,"1918  Pandemic

2019  Pandemic"
558,"okay okay but
has anyone noticed?!
1620, pandemic, 1720, pandemic, 1820, pandemic, 1920, pandemic...2020..PANDEMIC"
559,"As of July 9th: 557,405 deaths with a CFR of 4.5%.  I would like if Brew would put out another video like this some time soon, because it is 3 months later and the death count is twelve times more.  We don't yet know how this will all end, but  it is now a little closer"
560,I hope we get vaccines ready by end of 2020 . That should break the virus spreading. Otherwise this covid 19 will be worse than 1918 flu .
561,Just tell us the facts. No memes. You can't talk to people through pictures of Donald Glover and Shia Lebouf. It's dumbing it down.
562,"We have to remain positive. What do you want to manifest?(Attracted )  More of the same or...health,  freedom, love and understanding. We pull it to us. Watch your thoughts. Try not to live in fear. Have Faith. We have no control over the outcome except for this. Meditation will help those experiencing anxiety and depression. Tons of free guided meditations on you tube. Much love to you all 💕"
563,They're not taking it serious if they did the USA would take it as serious as the Manhattan project.
564,imagine 5 years of quarantine
565,Update: america is now first of covid
566,The Kansas swine flue brought to Europe in 1918 was much stronger then Corona lab made virus!!! Corona virus is nothing compare to Influenza 1918!
567,"Why after more than 100 years of record keeping is the annual flu now referred to as pandemics. And why after having a number of flu strains named covid is Covid 19 not a flu.
Perhaps it's the fact that Covid 19 is man made and previous annual flu's were not."
568,Florida just dont gaf at the moment
569,I won’t be able to go to high school😔
570,July 28..gloves!
571,And all the Non-Americans laugh because America is just prolonging Quarantine as a means for politics.
572,"2019 was iffy the begining extremly good second half absoulte bad, but like 2020 is nope

Enjoy a nightmare"
573,5 months later after you made this. We are at a 0.05 percent death rate and some  As low as 0.01 . Not the worst pandemic.  Not by far.
574,Funny how Black Death was dug up...I guess they knew Covid wasn't going to live up to their expectations.
575,nobody is dying from this.
576,Social distencing isn't a problem for vr users we can hug you and cuddle you and pet you! All without being there irl :D
577,Well that took a quick turn..
578,"China covered it up fast enough for it to spread to the world
Thanks CCP"
579,"our current technology and knowledge cant be used efficiently because the funds are going to nonsense choices of the governments, prioritizing the pandemic and carefully handling the economy should be the first step to make a difference"
580,October 2020 - USA Death count is at 220K
581,"I had a bird, her name was enza, I opened the window, and in flew enza = influenza! (I was told this was a jump rope  rhyme at the time of Spanish influenza)"
582,On the next episode of How Terrible of A year 2020 Has Been we’ll explore how September. . .
583,what if this now is like a Russian Influenca Primer ?  Dramatic Chipmunk Music
584,Pandemic durations vary depending on how severe the disease or virus is. The H1N1 pandemic in 2009 lasted about 10 months while the Spanish Flu lasted two years.
585,i bet covid 19 will last at least 4 years
586,"Look, millions of people have recovered from the virus making them immune to it. Its like a tetanus shot. They give you the virus, then your immunity fights it. The media should tell people the truth instead of instilling fear in everyone. There is a 92% chance that everyone in the world has gotten it, recovered and they didnt even know it."
587,"It will be over by April 2021, with global numbers at 70 million, and deaths at 1.7 million. In the US, 11 million cases, and 260,000 deaths."
588,"There already has been one billion doses of H_C_Q given - up to Jan 2020 for mal_aria....   Now.... it's dangerous?  Nobody really believes this.   Use that, plus Z*n_c and a Z   Pack...   Thumbs up."
589,Social distancing? How can one be distant and social at once. News speak again.
590,My family has been in the same house for the past 100 years in SF.
591,Baaaaah...
592,it came from canada.... from a congregation...
593,its the exact opposite with coronavirus
594,"The only way to never get sick is to never leave your house. If you are okay with that then by all means stay home but I know that me personally I have a strong immune system and I haven’t been sick in about 3 years and it was from a common cold. I have been around over 1,000 people and still haven’t gotten covid so it is possible to go outside without getting sick you just need to wash your hands and keep your hands away from your face"
595,"There is one theory that it came from French ducks during WWI, and there is also another theory that suggests it came from a Kentucky chicken farm."
596,"A random, racist naming of the plague by English-language sources eager to shift blame, an America hurrying to put its people back to work at the expense of their safety, a general inability to even know how many people are being affected. Yup, nothing like Covid-19. Nothing. At. All."
597,At least your rich if you bought socks around the beginning of the pandemic
598,Who is watching in 2019
599,I wonder what this video would say as of late July?  Because the numbers in the USA have risen dramatically since this was made.
600,"Wow, UK Govt are repeating all the Spanish Flu mistakes with Covid-19."
601,Haha now the US is winning 😐
602,Read the history of tb
603,3 months since this video came out turns out almost every country had implemented measures to limit spread aside from The U.S of course our legislature is incompetent and America is full of skeptics who believe this outbreak is just some government ploy and said skeptics refuse to wear masks and refuse to social distance themselves
604,"I don't know why they compare this to the 1918 pandemic when we're so much more advanced than we were back then, and if you research that pandemic most of the deaths were because they accidentally overdosed patients with too much aspirin. This is from official websites. What's going on now is scary but why do they compare the two?"
605,It’s repeating e
606,Blame game won’t work but almost every government is at fault and people too. The government that is most at fault is China and they should be held accountable instead of genocide or taking over countries.
607,Thank you Brew
608,or making the CFR.much higher thise dying without being tested or dying of undetermined sources. from current research the CFR runstnatnarround 8 percent andn20 percent of global fatality is from the USA. not really great.
609,the poor kitten got all blocky
610,It's much lower now then when this video was made.  Now mortality is .1% around 1-1000
611,"Quite scary watching this, 4 months later, given the current level of world fatalities, most especially in the USA."
612,"There is no definitive proof that can attribute the virus to any one specific country, so maligning a particular country is reprehensible. It should be more aptly referred to as the ""1918 Flu""!"
613,This is why I wanna go to space and live in space
614,"Assigning blame is a distorted way to say assigning responsibility and is typical of today's society, not owning up to one's responsibility."
615,In the UK its the young that are spreading and prolonging the virus thier attitude is i want to party and its afake.
616,Spread the virus only the strongest will survive!
617,"As of October 1, 2020 at 11:23 local time, the global death rate of COVID-19 is now 2.97% of all cases."
618,Please stop putting closed captions in videos!
619,"Wasn't it Texas that wanted to secede from the union?? Could that maybe happen now, given what's happening?? Oh, and Florida. I'm done with Florida."
620,The only positive side to this pandemic is that PH premium is now free
621,"Now we have 8,000,000+ cases in te U.S., with 200,000+ dead, & there are 40,000,000+ cases on the planet, & 1,000,000+ deaths on the planet."
622,That’s not a casket.. its a coffin
623,Wdym the 1918 pandamice lasted for only a year it was called the Spanish flu
624,"As a global community, we should have better measure in place going forward. We should prevent the spread early on and contain the disease. We should be more aware and on the look out for these disease earlier. We should be more open in dealing with it, and have global medical communication and share info on health and vaccines."
625,Oh my God seriously? 🤔🙅‍♀️😱✌that's a way to go !! Another 2 years oh know 🙅‍♀️😉
626,"The ""Spanish flu""  started  at Ft. Riley, Kansas. The Rockefeller Institute of Medicine shot soldiers up with a bacterial/viral concoction. I thought it was common knowledge, apparently not??? Why do you think solDIERS were the first to present symptoms?"
627,"9:02
“We now have robust healthcare system” - Unfortunately it’s all tied down to profits. 
Unless healthcare is in public domain and free for all citizens - we just cannot say that."
628,"Such a beautiful narrative to serve for a filthy Neo Marxism  propaganda 
It didn’t work in the past and it will never work"
629,Shutdown flying lockdown USA for five month tump could do it he lockup immigrants for a year
630,"In 1918 we didn’t have the right method  to count fatalités, so how diid we e des up with 50 millions deaths?"
631,"""RNA from influenza A, influenza B, and/or SARS-CoV-2
viruses is generally detectable in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens during infection.
Positive results are indicative of active infection but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic"
632,"Wake up people, you are all suffering  from historical amnesia-In1918 the idea of virus cause a flu is wrong. The electronic microscope was invented in 1935, and then used in 1939 to identifed the first virus. It was contaminated vaçcine using bacteria then cause the problem not virus. The socall second wave is bogus theory, playing out 1918 again."
633,E S T O R Y
634,Let's start with eradicating the virus in the Whitehouse!
635,And what am i meant to take from that?
636,Amazing how things change in a few months.
637,Can we call the new model year CHICOM 2020?🤔
638,So our immune system and health system is identical to 100 years ago and in peace vs 4 years of deadly war. Did I get it right? If yes congrats to the governments all over the world
639,I can’t believe there is a song about social distanting
640,1st steps first wear a mask
641,"Me : Watches Video

643,"COVID-19

Started - Jan 2020 | China 
Currently at - 40,200,000 cases WW"
644,Spanish Flu was biological war fare!
645,Wait didn't ww1 have 10 mil deaths and 20 mil casualties? And the Spanish flu had 20 mil deaths?
646,"That was 1918, they had nothing like we do today.  An absolute pathetic comparison"
647,america responded the same in 1918 and 2020
648,And that's when people were smarter.....
649,People not trusting what the government says about a pandemic from where does that sounds familiar
650,This motivating music in the background is nice... I love motivating music... Especially motivating battle music.... You have a good taste Bro(ew)... Liked the video.... <3
651,Covid is a political virus !!! STOP COMPARING WITH REAL DEADLY BACTERIA!!!!!!
652,No way I hope virus end within the year not 3 years
653,1918 Spanish flu 2020 china flu...
654,We are all one community.
655,Didnt a war end aswell?
656,How did the 1918 flu start anyway.????
657,Time is just an endless loop of disappointment...but sometimes...we just get more disappointed...but really...nothing changes
658,"This is a ""Scamdemic""... Nothing like what happened back then. Not to mention this mess was engineered too."
659,9:36 did he just rip that coffee pot's soul out?
660,Somebody going to make a movie about 2020?
661,excellent video!
662,It taking so long!!!
663,"If anyone is watching In the future, like if we survived this"
664,"""The government primarily lied""

My condolences, U.S. Your government doesn't seem to be getting smarter anytime soon."
665,15 million confirmed right now but probably 3-4x more than that aren't confirmed
666,All that and no mention of the cure...Copper and Ioniser...
667,"This information has gone out of date.   Covid 19 is now highest in the US! 3.68 million confirmed cases of Covid 19 in the US as of July 17, 2020!"
668,AHAHAHA
669,what's the answer to ''ending the COVID 19 earlier?? :)
670,Where's all the graves?
671,Everyone’s saying the ccp covered it but  I’ve been reading back issues of Time and there are blips about the coronavirus dating back to Jan 2020.
672,Now it is over 1 million deaths 😢
673,"If this has happened in one place should have taken action ASAP, not wait until months later, and then announced. This would've prevented this from spreading. It is going to be a long haul—Appx in about 2 to 3 years."
674,"9:35 Now he took that coffee jar out of that percolator, yet... See what happened?

There must be another set of coffee percolator at the back! 😂"
675,From a pig farm in the USA
676,That’s terrible but we know the covid-19 came from China because it was man made
677,I heard the Spanish flu came from China
678,"It is important to understand that during the 1914-18 period was a time of total war and malnutrition, most food came in tins in Europe especially used in the armed forces so people had massively inadequate immune systems lacking in a proper immune system vitamins Like Vitamin C and D3 zinc etc., and because of war were often crowded in buildings or trenches there was also a very immature health system and virtually no effective drugs or medical care."
679,"Deception, discord and the Dunning-Kruger effect are the greatest allies of the current viral pandemic."
680,Or the rest of the world could just learn from China’s response and eliminate the virus within a month.
681,Cfr....can anybody tell me d full form
682,"Again  history repeating itself except  people wereworking and business open ,"
683,GFR not as bad as this forecasted but it's not going away anytime soon.....
684,To anyone who’s feeling a little powerless about the state of the world during the pandemic (especially to those living in the US) keep in mind that a majority of Americans are against the anti lockdown protests. Don’t give up. Stay inside and always keep the vulnerable in mind.
685,15 months it lasted not 3years
686,Hey just saying that you don't say after decimal numbers as seventeen ect but as one seven
687,Home sweet home
688,All military pandemics.  All planned.  Every 100 years or so for centuries
689,I love the feel this character has. Looks like a private investigator we've hired who's been working tirelessly for like... a week or more to bring us the information we contracted him to get and now he's briefing us on what he found. I love it!
690,"You missed one thing that affects CFR. Not recording deaths, Like China's 30+ million less registered cell phone accounts, and that on top of accunting for covid deaths."
691,This is just another obstacle for us to evolve in humanity
692,"Okay, but can we talk about what I dark sense of humor I have because I literally snorted in laughter at the angel of death hopping along on a horse with a golf club?"
693,"It is strange you should say this as it was a team of doctors and medical scientists that found, through repeated testing, that the flu of 1918 was NOT infectious.  It is a proven fact check it out."
694,Word!
695,Experimental vaccine.
696,the virus is dying out the same was as spanish flu numbers are going up but deaths are going down because the virus is burning itself out imagine it being like old age its copying itself all the time and it becoming less and less potent
697,This video aged bad CFR less then 1% already.
698,"""Unreported case can cause the Death rate to be much lower""? 
Yeah what about hundred thousand of ""lungs diseases"" death spike this month"
699,sheryl crow
700,I believe its gonna get worse before it gets better and not just talking about covid
701,A doctor on U tube mentioned that the hospital Admunistrator told him to put covid 19 on the death certificate ! Even tho person died of heart attack! Isn't that totally ridiculous ?
702,It's called the Spanish flu because it came from American
703,Youtuber GATURKS says: Did I miss the answer to the question of this video?  Or did it take them 10 min to say... we just have to do our part?🤦🏿‍♂️
704,reminder that in Sweden - a country that did nothing to combat Corona - had its deaths peak in April.
705,21 years
706,1918 didn't have air travel
707,"The spanish flu deaths were caused by bacterial infections due to poor medical hygiene and lack of proper quarantining procedures.
The Old Testament Bible has procedures for quarantining, so this knowledge had been in mankind's possession for at least 2000 years."
708,"Meanwhile..

Today:
People protesting about their RiGhTs being ViOlAtEd 💀"
709,Really good information. Thanks
710,Medical  technology is advance now to compare to what happened in Spanish flu  that takes yrs  it will never happen again
711,This year has mentally exhausted me. I can't imagine 2 more years over a virus with a 99.9% survival rate.
712,"God loves us,God will never leave us or betray us,just beileve to him."
713,I wanna go back to 2015
714,"Everyone in America can be tested, it's a matter of proper leadership, public co-operation, the use of technology, and most importantly the will to live."
715,Dude your Quebecois was pretty good.
716,Whos gonna tell him that the deaths are now in 1 million not 46k
717,History repeating itself in the U.S
718,The thing is everyone with Covid right now isnt going to the hospital.. watch Valuetainments video on masks.. the death rate realistically is under 2%
719,"Covid is nothing compared to spanish flu, all the data on covid is skewed because it was politicized so either side won't give any real data"
720,Who’s the murders protesters or beach parties or house parties
721,Cheery intro
722,"9:28 counter point on this: if a government (CCP) actively underreports their cases in order to control the narrative and make it seem that they're winning the war on the disease and try to get other countries to loan their defective equipment, they should be called out."
723,Well time to go to greenland
724,"If the US keep doing what they doing right now, this pandemic will keep on spreading and lasted 3 or more years."
725,this is year is a horror movie lol
726,I miss 2021
727,9:37 the duplicating freshpot? You should probably change that animation
728,"People the spanish flu lasted from February 1918 to April 1920. That's barley even two years and the reason for that was due to the lack of ""modern technology"" and the lack of proper procedures to come up with a treatment in a timely manner! Btw the 1918 spanish flu outbreak and the 2020 covid-19 pandemic are two different incidents from two different time periods. There are no comparisons! Also, quit believing everything that the media tells you and quit acting like snowflakes! That's one thing that the greatest/silent generations got right at least. No wonder why many late millennials and Gen Z (post millennials) won't be able to live past 30 plus. It's ridiculous at this point!"
729,Of people believe it's not going into next year well into the next ur blind
730,This aged like milk
731,My mother told me there were caskets piled on top of each other outside of funeral homes for they couldn't t bury them fast enough.  NOTHING LIKE TODAY. BLACK DEATH IS BACTERA AND CURABLECWITH ANTIBIOTICS. THIS ONE IS A SHAM.
732,Are you guys still afraid of a virus with about the same mortality rate as the flu last year?
733,No one excepts the Spanish influenza
734,"More fear proganda, this video hasn't aged well. Only fools are living in fear of a virus that has a average death of 80yrs old, pre existing conditions and  2% morality rate. 
This was never about a virus."
735,"Exactly 🤔why aren't their a mad dash to develop underground ""Bunkers"" !!!!!!!$$$$$___$$$$$
Oh wait😱😱😱😱
Can someone please give me my glasses 😲"
736,Noticed how lest developed countries are doing better than the US?
737,Where is your source for  5.1% CFR?
738,Thanks brew
739,This is a plandemic.. they will burn the world down before they will face exsposer for there sickness and darkness and evil committed against our country and our presidents hard work  ..
740,Good point on “stop blaming and do our parts”. Tons of trash talk out there but too little action. America is the worst because Americans aren’t willing to do their parts. They insist to go out and spread the virus. They believe it is their human right to infect ours.
741,"""Number of people,"" not ""amount of people"" [sic]"
742,the next years will be even worse than 2020 trust me
743,Sad😢😢😢😢

746,Oof
747,China again hmm @5:26
748,Damethisgottostop
749,"The difference now is, we have vaccines.  Vaccines for covid-19 will be wide spread no later than late spring."
750,"maybe the virus  back in the day would take 3 years to cure , but now the technology that we have is far more advance than before"
751,That certainly provided nothing of value.
752,This pandemic will last as long as it makes a convenient narrative to be reported on and will quickly peter out the moment it becomes convenient for the narrative.
753,Covid is the spanish flu on steroids
754,Typical mainstream brainwashing... clearly the the pandemic began in China dating back to November of 2019 and the World Health Organization and china covered up the problem... fast forward today late October 2020 Covid is a political tool of the far left to control the population forcing slaves to wear masks and comply with unreasonable restrictions on freedom and travel... only .05% death rate as an excuse to shut down the world economy.......pathetic behavior.
755,"Omg 1 view,  I feel special!"
756,New data and Sweden as well show forced measures don't work and the death rate is far lower than even now which is officially 1.3% but in reality is most likely less than .05%. You can only have an accurate number with an accurate numerator and denominator and that is impossible.
757,"The corporation's, government's and NSM are the killers here not the plandemic"
758,You mean to tell me that we won't be able to take a shower at a NJ gym until then?
759,"This video is saying that they don't know where the Spanish Flu came from yet it's a known fact it originated on a farm in Kansas. A boy on the farm then went to military barracks in the USA which were overcrowded, so spreading the virus. These men all then travelled to France to fight in the war, taking the virus to France with them. There they spread it to others. France and the USA wouldn't report on it though because of the war. It was then spread to Spain and many other countries. Spain being the only neutral country during the war reported on the pandemic and that's how it got the name Spanish Flu."
760,Let's quarantine forever and it will solve everything. Cough
761,Death rate should be 2 million by christmas
762,By confirmed cases and deaths Singapore has a ridiculous low death rate compared to other countries.
763,Hazmat suits with air tanks would be needed to actually stop or prevent a virus. Cloth masks and Er masks do 0 to prevent anything. Masks give people excuses to do two of the worst things to spread a virus. 1. Group together and 2. Not wash their hands.
764,"Let me guess, voting?"
765,"Is actually important to blame the (Chinese Communist Party) CCP Virus is not the first time they cover up statistics, important documents and silenced doctors from the start, now they have corrupted the WHO if we don't shine a light in these unwanted practices the history will repeat itself in the future."
766,Lol the CFR of covid isn't even 1%
767,Crazy how we watchin this about 100yrs ish before and only caring a bit next 100yrs when people learn about it they wont care much but it had such a big impact on our lives people will never understand fully
768,"The wrongly named Spanish Flu, which didn't originate in nor spread from Spain. Spain was the first country to openly talk about the flu on the news of the time."
769,How many more diseases do you think they have waiting in there underground labs to throw at us. I think many more... they won't stop..
770,"This video has started on such a positive note. Lets see how this turns out, I'm optimistic! 😂"
771,Yeah but that was lot worse  then this pandemic  plus we are more advanced  now with modern  medicine
772,"I hope this wake up call to humanity gets through to those who invade your personal space, those who cough & splutter all over you, and the unhygienic morons who don’t wash their hands after expelling human waste."
773,"blows my mind that people compare covid to this.....  This turns your skin blue and kills mostly 20 year olds, covid most of the time you don't know you have and kills majority 65 year olds with ore existing conditions..."
774,"Well, it turned out to be no more deadly than the seasonal flu.. Panic & misinformation made it out to be something as deadly as anything that came before!! 🙄 Counting 2 positives from one test here in the UK.. 🙄 One from the throat & one from the nose of the same person means 2 positives.."
775,Notifications brought me here and I am proud. #NotificationSquad
776,"If we all i mean EVERYONE stay in quarentine without seeing anyone for one month, the pandemic would’ve been gone"
777,You can’t compare the Black Plague and Spanish flu to this convid planddemic scamdemic hoaxvid govdid19 .....!!!!!!! Cause convid19 has the same recovery rate as any other flu season that we’ve all been threw since the beginning of time. The only difference is this time it’s a planned economic apocalypse cause the whole planet is over in-debt. Once New York goes bankrupt which should be soon the rest of the countries will just follow suit it’s inevitable at this point cause it was all planned hens planneddemic
778,"Covid-19 is like a crazy  ex gf, it probably won't completely go away and will always be hiding in the shadows, waiting to destroy everything/everyone you love when you think it's finally over..."
779,The prophecy is true.
780,"8:48
one week later, the total death is already 5 fold.
too soon"
781,Did this dude really just compare the Spanish flu to the black plague?
782,"Germ theory, as you refer to it, is a discredited, war based, model. As Pasteur said on his death bed, ""the terrain is everything"".....Rockefeller medicine co-opted the medical system and natural healing modalities were outlawed, resulting in the, cut, burn and poison, model we now have, with iatrogenic disease being the third greatest cause of death in the US.... the state is a pernicious beast in the thrall of global corporate interests...we will only be free when we take back our power and dismantle the corporate state...interestingly the wireless system was being switched on around the world at the time of the ""Spanish flu pandemic"", just as the 5G system is being implemented as covid is emerging as a pandemic....just sayin..."
783,Well 2020 just keeps on giving
784,Covid 19 will not end in 2023. This is our new normal whether you like it or not. We have not even begun properly yet. I can't wait for what happens in 2021 which will make 2020 seem like a walk in the park.
785,I love ur vids man♥️ thanks for giving me knowledge ND stay safe ND healthy
786,"Most people don't seem to realize that there is a large gray area between what can be perceived as black or white. 

Black being the idea that the sky is falling and that the virus will destroy us for years and we are doomed."
787,Yes but they had no vaccine.
788,Why is the cat animated and censored
789,oh borat you devil!!!
790,"Yet we still have some people in the US refusing to wear a mask outside because they want to exercise their ""freedom"". I'm living in Singapore, yes it was uncomfortable wearing a mask and staying at home on lockdown was no fun, but at least we got the virus under control now and we get to go out again. This virus is very real, ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" ain't gonna save you from it, please be smart, wear a mask and keep your distance, avoid gatherings. US is a big country, it will take a whole lot more effort to control this virus compared to Singapore."
791,These numbers need to be updated
792,why is the black death drawn as a virus? it's a bacteria lol
793,Scientific name of Virus should be changed to China.
794,I can't wait to see any country announcing they found the cure....actually i won't be alive at that time nvm
795,"Now it’s October and numbers are twice as high as April, let’s see how bad it is now"
796,The virus comes from China
797,Imagine how worse the virus will get when school starts again
798,What’s CFR?
799,"217 views, how am I this early?"
800,You should do a video on mask wearing during the 1918 flu and San Francisco forced mask wearing in public and the number of infected fall greatly.  I read one place a 50% drop in death within a few weeks about maybe you can find more information about it.
801,At least 30m going out and about all day....government produces 5 million masks a week...meaning people have to reuse old mask.
802,"china 4.06% thats a load of BS if i ever heard one. real numbers are probably even larger then italys. they are communists they dont want to tell you the truth, only the ""communist truth"" which is bs"
803,LUCKY THIS OVER HYPED OVER COUNTED INFECTIONS AND DEATH PANDEMIC WILL END NOV 4TH 2020.............ASK YOURSELF WHY NOV 4TH? IF U KNOW THE ANSWER THAN YOU KNOW WHATS REALLY GOING ON
804,End of October.  Cfr is less than 1 percent.  That didn't age well.
805,*2 years
806,is this a spoiler
807,Way to stop it...TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
808,"“Many cases are flying under the radar”
Shows Solid Snake in a cardboard box 8:26"
809,"COVID-19 around the world as of October 18, 2020, now has a death rate of just 2.78%"
810,This is not 1918 is this an arm of the teachers union.
811,Must’ve been an election that year. Inflated numbers and racism didn’t really exist.
812,meanwhile in belgium LETS NOT CLOSE SCHOOLS AND GO TO SCHOOL WITH BUSES FULL OF PEOPLE :DDD
813,I love the aesthetic of a depressed professor you have going.
814,Belgium is not a country worth mentioning according to this video.
815,"Since before smart phones were invented life gets worst & worst insted of geting better with all this tech, I used to have a good sleep before."
816,wash yourselves and pray earnestly people
817,Please stop advertising AARP.
818,I gotta disagree on shifting blame completely. We already know China was not communicating with the rest of the world as much as it could have and the risk of another problem like this happening again will remain unless they can cooperate with the rest of the world like they should have with this pandemic.
819,Wearing*
820,I miss 2018.
821,"Propaganda then, and propaganda now"
822,"60 million people infected with H1N1. Not a peep. COVID19 now with a death rate of less than 1 percent and the world shuts down. BTW, they have a cure for the 1918 flu. They did a good job with the fear mongering in this video. Oh, and you know that living in fear lowers your immune system. That's a fact."
823,2:02  Death has never looked so cute.
824,Spanish Flu Was 80M-120M Deaths
825,Not taking that vaccine
826,"This CFR IS bs.  Less than 1% if one counts all cases, not just hospitalization cases"
827,TOO bad nowadays we do not have such a strong flu pandemic that will wipe out hundreds of millions of people at age 25 but I still hope there will be strong viruses out there. I will be partying like crazy if global pandemic will happen that wipes nations from the face of earth that will be happiest day in my life. Some governments like USA still developing deadliest bio-weapons as last effort to hold on their empire.
828,"Meanwhile in 2033:

831,I read where some scientists predict the US will be banned from the rest of the world for the next 5 years....and it will last much longer in the US than any other place in the world......
832,This is all planned
833,2 months later covid claimed 512k...
834,No way Covid CFR rate is 5.1 percent. Probably more like 0.3 percent.
835,And how does not blaming the governments who allowed the spread of the virus do us any good? The CCP knew this was spreading from human to human so they shut down domestic travel from Wuhan but not international travel. The world got pwnd by communism and corruption.
836,Bruh 2023 is for the Nevula Virus
837,The Spanish Inquisition I think I said it wrong
838,"There's an important and plausible theory being missed in this video. The reason the 2nd wave was more lethal may well have been directly related to the war. All viruses have less- and more-lethal strains. Typically, those infected with more-lethal strains naturally ""self-isolate"" because they're too sick to be out in public - they're in hospital or at least laid-up at home in bed."
839,CFR is interesting but useless. The IFR is the important number. The covid 19 IFR is below 0.07
840,"These megalomaniac narcissist ruling elite won't relinquish the hold over the populace now found it so easy, 80% jump in claimants to the dreaded Tory universal credit since March lockdown, the world's economies brought to their knees just so the few super rich can rebuild in their own mold, speak your truth folks wherever you can, this plandemic is quickly becoming a shamdemic....."
841,19
842,"Yeah, they did not have washing machines, dryers or refrigerators. They also did have easy access to doctors and medicine.And they did not have cell phones.  This covid should not last long. We have modern technology.  If it lasts long then we are being duped."
843,THIS VIDEO IS GOLD
844,well there are far too many people in the world ruining it. Perhaps its a good thing. On the other hand if your the one who dies it isnt.  People numbers cant keep rising though.
845,Except the Spanish flu is several orders of magnitude more deadly than Coronavirus. Almost no one under 70 dies unless they have significant pre existing health issues
846,The black plague was caused by  bacteria.
847,"The worst thing we can contract from this pandemic is loss of sleep and anxiety. ”You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” Marcus Aurelius"

849,Oh geez....
850,We are all one community
851,Vaccines aren’t safe
852,"“The UK, Germany and France combined.”
I would like to see how that would play out historically."
853,the only difference during influenza and now is that people are much dumber now
854,It lasted 23 months
855,vaccine poggers
856,"October COVID-19 CFR= 0,13 %   Reported by WHO  ..."
857,Mass migration and globalisation will forever doom us to a fate of pandemics.
858,So basically the we are not top of the food chain and the world is run by little microscopic organisms that are a-holes.
859,"The vaccine isn't going to eradicate COVID, most likely a vaccine will only be effective for a few months. On top of that, people can carry the virus and not even know they have it. This started with one person getting it so as long as one person on Earth has it the cycle will just start over. We'll be living with the virus for the rest of our lives."
860,The influenza pandemic lasted until 1920!! So that lasted only 2 years not 3 years
861,"Annoying, I could only sit thru 3 min of this video, the content could be interesting, but the casual delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  Plus the childish animations look immature and don't really give people any proper frame of reference for what is an extremely serious time for the globe and mankind.   Obviously a lot of skill went into the production of this - but maybe think about using your talent for something that can actually help people.  You need to help inform and educate people about a topic like global pandemic - not try to ""entertain"" them."
862,Shifting blame? Someone has to be held accountable. We all know it's China's CCP
863,"Don’t compare this pandemic to the Spanish flu, theres no comparison.  Seeing as theres 7 billion  people in the world  compared to 1918. This video was obviously made before they knew more about it about it."
864,"In Brazil, 100k of deads aren't enough to the president and most people"
865,"Wow, love how the story escalated quickly within 30 seconds in this video."
866,"Amount of deaths is irrelevant when go by percentages, percentage wise the Black Plague was the worst with a whopping 60% of the world’s population died from one outbreak of the bubonic plague."
867,Wear a mask
868,"It might help if the true causes of deaths were ACCURATELY reported not all attributed to the covid thing. 
Btw, masks are almost useless. Handwashing is much more effective."
869,"we just have to do our part thats your response ? maybe trying to flatten the exponential economic curve can be a better option by giving people the best option of living , by the slogan LIVING is better than SURVIVING, so lets make this happen, by increasing social distancing by implementing 3 days of work per week and 4 days of free time per week  and staying with same wages ,also who is in the top of the curve ,is his/her moral duty to invest in long run of our civilization if not he will lose points in the economy. lets change things we have a massive opportunity in our civilization we are not in 1918 we are in 2020 we have the internet, were all of us can express and expand ideas a lot faster than in the old times. sorry for my bad english ."
870,Talk about propaganda!!
871,"Take your masks off and see the truth as the politicians/media/doctors etc are playing an evil scaremongering game!?-----------world is great, we know about the dangers in the jungle and oceans but it is the people you have to worry about!?"
872,Sounds familiar
873,Can you turn off subtitles?
874,"Here in the UK they're conserving testing for critically ill cases and essential workers, so the CFR looks a lot higher than it is. My household of 4 got all the symptoms a few weeks ago and we were told to just stay indoors and isolate for weeks, but we weren't offered testing or included as a statistic."
875,Spanish Flu?   Now that name is unfair
876,I think i have covid 
877,I think i have covid 
878,Do people in 1918 feeling nostalgic for 1900? Probably because 1918 was the worst year ever back then. So they're doing the same thing. We did 102 years ago! Surprising isn't it?
879,Literally the first half minute of this video got very depressing very vast.
880,USA is always winning...
881,Once we have the vaccine we will no longer be humans
882,"With   modern   science ,   Dr.   F@uci   &   Gill   Bates   it   will   take   more   than  3   years ,   easy ,   easy ..."

You left out the part where during the 1918 pandemic that the US made mask wearing the law & people wore them proudly as a display of patriotism..."
885,If you are reading this. Then you are alive.
886,Easy to end it; just turn off the news
887,Just explain every virus on China
888,"Covid would end if they would use hydroxycloriquine as a treatment for it it’s like a tamiflu for covid but they won’t promote it because fachi and all the big people will
Make billions if not trillions off of the vaccine"
889,"This is silly, everyone knows that blood from newly slaughtered virgins is the only cure for coronavirus."
890,"The origin of the Spanish flu was domestic birds, like the origin of practically all outbreaks of deadly viruses and pandemics for thousands of years including this pandemic, animals we now needlessly 🌱 eat 

We could have prevented this pandemic by eating plants instead of eating playful loving beings "
891,China didn't do its part
892,End it when the government admits its biggest scam in modern history
893,"The coronavirus will not disappear, it will remain as well as the flu.  Our body has simply never fought it, and does not know that it is not so terrible at all."
894,"☹ No, no, no, no, no!!!!!"
895,"Has everyone lost their ability to think critically?  I’m still shocked that people don’t feel something fishy about the measures that have been taken worldwide based on what we’ve seen so far.  Age 0-24 chances of dying are 1 in 250,000 people and they want to shut down schools...think people and then ask, “why would this be happening?”.  Then search for answers because this is NOT normal protocol for the situation."
896,well said brew
897,God has everything under control. Just don't panic. God will protect his children.
898,7:44 animal crossing footage lol
899,You can't trust the numbers.
900,CFR of 5.1% LOL try 0.2%
901,Uhm been know this... if you check a debit card it expires normally in 2023 because I’m sure they are trying to move us into some crypto currency or they are starting to lead all types of shopping through online since it’s become so popular. (Grocery pick up to amazon to Shopify) Knowing that people are afraid of change they have a “pandemic” naturally causing us to adapt so people have more reason to accept it
902,YOU STICKIN BOTS!
903,"So, I gotta know... did the mom get sick and die, too?"
904,Lol. Covid less than 1%. Not the same.
905,this sounds very familiar
906,"Why you don’t tell everybody that’s this going  to be forever. 
That’s all the governments in the world want 
who cares  anymore 
That’s means we don’t have leaders  in this world nobody cares about humans "
907,You also can't use total deaths to say which was worse. You gotta account for population inflation like with money. You gotta make a educated guess on population verse infected population and deaths. That's off reports and such info is lacking. Then compare them to see which was worse. Also in older days stuff traveled slow so it may not fully spread and we had less health understanding n such. So it's really impassable to figure out which was worse using a micro scope and lot looking at entire picture
908,"Conclusion ""we just have to do our part?"" Yup... Keep the borders protected...."
909,"It is 2020. Now we have really good different kind of soaps , bleach , cleaners,  disinfectants, antibacterial everything, lysol type products , hot running water everywhere to clean and wash clothes , we can get info and news  through  wifi now , and so it cannot get to the 1918 proportions.but  It is getting insane out there...plus everyone forgets we have immune systems that develope herd immunities..nature is sometimes your best defence"
910,"1918: ""Just a bad cold""
2020: ""Just a bad flu""

1918: Quarantine, Testing, Identification, Medication, Wearing Masks"
911,"Spanish flu? What a terrible injustice to call it that, please do your research, it’s totally unfair to associate a nationality to a disease just because that country was the only one to publish freely the records, it was not originated in Spain but nobody seems to care about that"
912,Censoring a cat 😏😏😆😅😂
913,"Australian national anthem.... “for those who’ve come across the seas, we’ve boundless plains to share...”... ummm, actually no we don’t now. We need space to social distance. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is why community transmission is so low here- many of us don’t choose to all live on top of each other. City folk are another story.... 🤪"
914,Not really comparable....
915,Spanish flu???  You meant american flu.
916,Do some real research.
917,"Covid is going to be around longer than it needed to. Terrible leadership from top down. I don't care what party you prefer, everyone dropped the ball. Including citizens."
918,"After nine months of the pandemic 0.3% of the World’s population has at some stage been reported as infected with covid-19.  Assuming a recovery period of 14-days, on average at any given time over the last nine months 0.016% of the World’s population would have been actively infected. As a comparison this is a direct quote from the NIH “Estimates of the international prevalence of schizophrenia among non-institutionalized persons is 0.33% to 0.75%”. Schizophrenia alone is up to 46 times more prevalent than covid-19. The virus has been linked to 0.01036% of the population dying worldwide over this period, approximately 3000 people per day. This represents about 2% of the global daily death rate from all causes of death."
919,It was much worse the this Plandemic!
920,"I think it’s offensive to compare Spanish flu to Covid 19 the official death rate for under 65s healthy or under is 0.09 so it’s not a comparison at all. Further more I’m sure we would have coped with the Spanish flu a lot better now / with modern medicine, nutrition & hygiene standards."
921,"I Dr. still believes demon spirits cause disease in women.
But that’s also the one Trump and his son spoke highly of... so we aren’t as advanced as one would think in 2020.  Pitiful"

923,So don't fly anywhere for 3 years ....👍👍👍👍
924,"Too bad the trump administration won’t watch this 
It could be educational for them"
925,Poor Dude!
926,"Yes, but, THIS time around we humans now have advanced medical knowledge.... not perfect, but way way, ahead of 1918. One thing I notice, that we had war, followed by major disease,  I suspect that pattern to be reversed this time. WAR  ( major war) may now follow."
927,"9:18 “Shows Animal Crossing New Horizons while talking about the touring industry” 
Well, at least the villagers don’t have to worry about the pandemic."
928,Spanish flu ORIGINATED IN ENGLAND NOT SPAIN!! Of course as usual USA whites BROUGHT it to the AMERICAS!  Just like present times with the COVID19.
929,but unfortunately one thing we didn't account for were karens
930,For Corona virus to go away
931,"Just not true !

934,Carlisle will save us all
935,JESUS CHRIST NO
936,The better way to end the corona is to shoot the infected but I feel like you would finish all your weapons ammo in the first city/town you attack
937,I told & bought masks for all my close ones when wuhan was quarantined. It was obvious to me what was comming. IMO all governments failed for 2. reasons: 1. not wanting to spread panik and therefor hiding alot of important information to the public & 2. believing the numbers of china when everyone knew the chinese shouldn't be believed
938,Currently we know that the Covid-19  CFR is about 0.14% (just a little bit higher than the flue)...simply calculated by the WHO estimate that 10% of the world population has been infected and the death toll is 1.12 milj people.
939,"That was a REAL pandemic. This is man made, fuelled by false stats, huge media indoctrination and shutting up REAL FRONT LINE MEDICAL staff. This is about controlling us through fear in order to shove a c"
940,Populations downsize.....
941,"The migrant Chinese workers who crossed Canada by train were shipped to Europe to dig trenches for the war. So they infected those in north America then soldiers in Europe. The dates are wrong as WW-1 was from 1914 through 1918. The ""Spanish"" flu raged for years before being reported on by Spain in 1918 due to media black-out and their reporting on it was probably a contributing factor in ending the war."
942,"@7:25, unfortunately, at the moment that death count is 346k, not ""46k""."
943,"Dude just straight ignored that fatalities and cases aren’t always reported consistently.  In the U.S.A. Many deaths are claimed as vivid deaths, when in reality they aren’t.  What do I mean by this?: Deaths from people that were already ill, and then got covid-19, which finished them off, aren’t covid deaths, often times they would have died from any other flu-like desease."
944,"False positives, reclassifying deaths, the real rate is not 5%"
945,Nothing better then jail .. you work out you play xbox ps4 pool etc..
946,"800,000 total worldwide deaths now"
947,2:52 The CCP is basically repeating the same strategy of what the US did over a hundred years ago. The CCP burned their history books so they never learned from the experience.
948,D
949,"Wearing masks and staying 6, 7, or 10 feet apart, are NOT going to end the pandemic sooner.
They are probably good things to do, but they will prolong it, not speed it."
950,"Everyone is saying how people are gonna make a movie on surviving COVID, but it’s really easy. Stay home. Quarantine, wear a mask.... this is something a large portion of earths population has failed to do"
951,This is why u live in canada kids
952,can someone be kind enough and come to a conclussion of this video so i can skip the video?
953,its the plauge
954,What's worst Spanish flu or Kung Flu
955,"This is not a pandemic ... this is an epidemic of quite small proportion. One can argue that those are the regular seasonal death as we got every year. People are so brainwashed by the media, they don’t think anymore. This is sad ."
956,"And masks didn’t work back then either.
But herd immunity did!  And to this day there are no vaccines for flu nothing but your immune system will prevent illness.
Diet and exercise to maintain stress levels."
957,So I watched this to hear about that only way to end it earlier. And didn't hear anything about it.
958,Silly rabbit. Tricks are for kids!
959,Yeah that’s not gonna happen
960,"Pretty sure that ebola, influenza and sars are not coronaviruses...ebola looks like a worm"

963,2012 isn't the worst year in 21st century 2020 is
964,"The rate for covid is not 5%! It was not correct,"
965,"This is what All Nations , and it's people need to do for Covid 19  ... The Lord is trying to get out attention but very few are listening to Him .. If my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways  , will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land "
966,I'm tired
967,It's still the CCP's fault
968,The high death toll may have lasted 3 years but I doubt that the virus has completely  disappeared and I believe that it still kills thousands of people annually. Now it would be classified as one of the hundreds of seasonal flus. How have people NOT learned from it? Trump certainly hasn´t and some idiots believe him.  Covid 19 will not magically disappear either. It will linger for years despite vaccines although the death toll will fall as immunity develops.
969,I miss 2006
970,"💦🤏
COUGH"
971,Pls wear your masks
972,"9:19 I was listening to this while playing animal crossing , I decided to look at this very moment and I got startled."
973,"Politicians, and their perverted political ideas, and policies are the big reasons Covid 19 continues to proliferate, and threaten American lives, and our current existance!!  Every thing currently happening in America is directly related to The Pandemnic.   Most important is our flawed, and corrupt political system!!! We have to change it now or it will be too late !!"
974,This sounds like the trump virus.
975,"Such ignorance. The denominator for the mortality rate is the total number of cases, not the total number of reported cases. The total number of cases is also estimated to be between 10 to 20 times as high as the number reported. If that is true, the death rate is more like .5 to 1%."
976,That w as s flu this is a Corona Virus. Ridiculous comparison.
977,"Covid 19 : Hecc, I hope I don’t sick.             Spanish Flu: Hecc, I hope I go to heaven..."
978,Question...how long do we wear masks for? Viruses come back every year. They mutate. It just happens. If this corollavirus was actually deadly I would be scared but 99.9% of healthy people will be just fine and build immunity. Are you going to wear a mask forever? Asking for a friend.
979,"Covid been around less than a year, and already have a vaccine in the making, wow what a joke, talk about a plandemic!"
980,The current pathogen is nothing like the Spanish flu. Nothing to see here.
981,And this is why being a gamer is beter.
982,Yet another video keeping my entertained. Thanks Brew!
983,"If you do actually research u can see that literally Corona is just another Cold flu season like any other year. You can even look at the compared charts bc they are exactly the same. Extremely low death rates with high rate “CASES” I have a lot more facts to be added if u are curious, just tryna spread the word because there is proof out there and real news saying it’s a fraud to scare people like us into control.😒"
984,Covid will be end soon if we changed the mentality... Everyone is afraid of death... But there is only 3% mortality and they have a weak immune system. We prepared our mind to scared from it. If we increase immunity and take precautions there will be end of corona. Even many surveys reported that many people build antibodies in them even they had a very few symptoms and many are non symptomatic. Corona is not that much dangerous but our mindset is!
985,No comparison sorry.
986,The China Flu is bad!!!
987,8:59 Social distancing is here treated as a joke ...
988,How is the Spanish flu the worst if the Black Plague was worse? Is it because it wasn’t global?
989,its 2020 not 1900s... health care should be better now.
990,Itll be gone by Easter
991,NO U DON'T
992,"Three years?! And there's no shortage of people now,  in this country or on this planet because of it.
And yet, three months into 2020 with medicines and procedures that outshine those of 90 years ago the American people are being put under house arrest and an open ended quarantine.

998,India had 40 million deaths
999,"No urgency to find a source or understand the origin of  the virus, because its clear its not natural and man-made, its just now about government control. To say its made in china is racist and shut down, the origin of anything in a distant land thats negative is racist, regardless of fact. sick of this narrative, so flawed."
1000,SARS cov-2 has an (RO) R naught factor of around 3-4 exactly as deadly as severe flu and nothing more. People really must start getting their data and information from Non politicized media and science  organizations!

1007,"Really smart video, definitely answered any follow up questions I had as they came up. *Get out of my head!!"
1008,"Coronavirus has spread all over the world, because of the WHO, they kept postponing and postponing the declaration of a state of emergency until it spread everywhere, an idea would be that when a virus appears in a country, that country should take action.  urgent, to isolate the country, and to stop the possible virus from exactly where it starts.  .... in this way, we can stop possible pandemics, and the virus will disappear even faster in taking this measure, and that country will be helped economically by other countries, after."
1009,2012 was wrong its actually 2020 :P This video was kind of different scary :O
1010,"Dude, you're videos are awesome! But it hurt my soul the way you read decimal numbers. 2.16% is two point one six percent. 11.75% is eleven point seven five percent. Great video though, thanks!"
1011,Love this video thanks for doing it. I learned a lot.
1012,I want my whol life back:(
1013,The completely affectless delivery of some of your script with lines describing catastrophic trauma hits the ear in an odd way.
1014,"Funny that's what's going on now 
Guess they never learned"
1015,"Every time I see someone talk about this, I'm reminded of a line from the regent in Dishonored.  In that game, the regent introduced a plague as a means of reducing what he saw as the surplus poor population and it swiftly gets out of control.  He has a line, ""You can see how it would have worked, if people had just done what I told them to do!"""
1016,Sounds eerily familiar...argh!!

1023,"1:08 Uh oh, does the second wave from history mean that things could get even worse with this virus?"
1024,So if covid 19 goes this way guess we are finished
1025,"1918 flu was caused by none other than H1N1.  Once they're out there, they're out there."
1026,How can you claim the Spanish flu was worse than the plague when the plague had 4x as many deaths? Nonsense!
1027,Might be time for an update.
1028,Actually the estimated death rate of all those other illnesses was the number that died divided by the number that had either died or recovered.  doing that for the current virus as of July 12 2020 the US death rate is closer to 8%  That is taking the number died divided by the number that either died or recovered
1029,We just have to do our part.
1030,I died when 8:58 came on

1047,"We are so doomed as more & more biological warfare gets released, Covid19 is jjst beginning honestly & now they are saying there’s another round if a new swine flu that’s been released"
1048,I can't find much information on the 1889 Russian Flu.
1049,"*👉Those who do not heed the lessons of the past, are doomed to repeat them.  It originated in the USA and was carried to Spain onboard ships carrying US Troops."
1050,Yup still true.
1051,The only true way to end COVID-19 is to end everything else.
1052,idk but i'm scared of what's coming next... :(
1053,See the pandemic response plan hasn’t changed then
1054,Cfr is at 0.039% according to the CDC as of July 1
1055,Redo this video with current numbers please!
1056,"What a load of tripe.
What is there to compare this to the 1918 flu?
Different hygiene
Different social attitudes"
1057,I wonder how many unconfirmed cases there are.
1058,1918 there technologies was weak now we are better now

1064,But what's the way? You didn't tell that
1065,So this vid was no help to the current crisis? Please correct me if I'm wrong!

1074,"Social systems sometimes are helpful to people's hardtime;, but sometimes not. Only Jesus is the forever Saviour to every human being! Just believe in Him, read His words and obey them, you'll definitely get His blesses more than you imagine!"
1075,"Incredibile how we did not study the Spanish flu in school. I mean, somebody was thinking it would have been useless to teach people about health risks and how to react to a pandemic.
I hope any future kid will study this so to avoid all the deniers, anti masks people etc."
1076,"Sounds like the 1918 flu was much worse than covid19. Most people recover from covid 19 and don’t even show any symptoms of it. Covid tests can’t be trusted when a pawpaw tests positive. Deaths are being overinflated since hospitals get more money for declaring a death a covid death.
1918 flu had packed hospitals. Hospitals in 2020 are so empty that nurses are spending their time learning dance moves."
1077,history repeats itself
1078,I can't imagine how bad it would be if the Black death came back but was airborne. Our idiots today you can't even stay indoors for a stretch of time without it being an issue. They risked death over wiping out though virus.
1079,"FYI:
The 1918 Spanish Flu 
started in the USA. "
1080,"The Case fatality rate(CFR) for covid is certainly not anywhere near 5.1% as mentioned here. It is certainly now known to be well below 1%, and probably somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3%. This is just another unfortunate example of how fearmongering re covid has sadly been allowed to replace fact and truth over the past number of months!"
1081,"Hopefully this will finish off two auxiliaries of BLM,the NBA and the NFL."
1082,I know the answer and it's called turning to God but it's not going to happen.

1085,I hope Bill Gates can save us with his vaccine....not sure I can afford it however...
1086,Wasn't half of Italian death count false based on the prime ministers speech in parliament?
1087,"You cannot draw any comparison to 1918 and 2020! Heck. They hadn't even discovered penicillin in 1918. We have far better drugs now, and covid mortality is far below the mortality of the 1918 pandemic! Ludicrous to even try!!"
1088,Oopsy
1089,"Please be aware, the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) was caused by a BACTERIA - yetsenia Pestis, not a virus. We can almost always treat a bacterial infection. We rarely can treat an acute viral infection."
1090,Update the death toll...
1091,No mention of the number of 1918 deaths caused not by the flu but by over prescription of the new wonder drug aspirin to people who already had the flu?

1099,Nobody knows
1100,I believe the Spanish flu . I don’t believe covid 19 .
1101,Shifting blame precisely where it is due is how you get people to do their part. You think the CCP will do the right thing when no one is looking?
1102,"This is how the 20's started:

New Pandemic
Possibility for new wars"
1103,I just like to mention it's got a death rate of about 5% but that's cuz we're all in lockdown!
1104,Yes and that means what to us today not much mate
1105,"Huge differences between the flu pandemic of 1918 and COVID-19. The first one is that multiple governments are not actively keeping it quiet. Also, the r0 and the death rates are also vastly different. Unfortunately, this seems to be more about sensationalizing for the hysteria and clicks instead of honest factual comparison. There have been more recent pandemics that come closer to mimic the COVID-19, but they do not have those panic causing bumbers."
1106,"Study Wim Hof. Hot & cold showers every morning. Simple & effective. Eat healthy whole foods, exercise daily. Vitamin C & D & zinc."
1107,"The main problem with SARS-CoV-2 in developed countries isn't the death rate at this point, but the strain it puts on healthcare resources and the economy. We're only a few months into something that is probably going to dominate our world for 5 to 10 years, longer if it mutates or if global institutions collapse."
1108,The 1918 flu was over by 1919.
1109,"I like how you say ""shifting the blame"" without being specific enough for anyone to call you out on anything. Very brave."
1110,"Many countries that let methods of fighting the 1918 flu slip to the wayside are not making the same mistakes.
BUT THE US IS MAKING THE EXACT SAME MISTAKES,
despite other countries having learned. Covfefe-19   IS NOT BEING DEALT WITH EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE HOW SERIOUS IT IS, TO HELP HIM GET REELECTED. "
1111,"I wish you guys good luck for the next two years...
Remember this virus will be testing us individually...
Good luck again...."
1112,Nonsense. There was NO antibiotics back then. Cause of death mostly bacterial infection. Due to lack of hygiene...
1113,I’m here before there’s any dislikes lol
1114,I SHALL BE HERE FOR EVER
1115,"Well, I’ll tell ya one thing.  Nobody will applaud China’s “quick” action."

1126,Covid-19 is not  INFLUENZA

1128,"Thank you for another great, informative video"
1129,"CDC COV19 CFR is now .2%.  35% of people who get it are asymptomatic.  The Ferguson model, which was used to legitimize the lockdowns assumed a CFR of 5-7%.  Just a bit off there."
1130,"Make a vid about contact lenses and what happens when you sleep in them, just an idea."
1131,It has been opined by a Dr. who studied this pandemic that the majority of deaths occurred due to overdosing of Aspirin causing excessive bleeding in the lungs. See Dr. Eric Berg.
1132,The 1918 pandemic was a tragedy because everyone took aspirin for their symptoms as it was unknown at the time that aspirin makes influenza much worse. This is not very comparable to the current pandemic.
1133,"This ain’t the flu, Hoss. No comparison..."
1134,"I just watched the video but it doesn’t actually say what that one way is to end COVID-19 earlier.

Does anyone know what it is?"

1136,"I needed a disclaimer before that intro 
Dark xD"
1137,"When ur third:
I’ll just say first"
1138,"Exposure to the sun and fresh air REDUCED the number of Spanish Flu deaths by almost 2/3rds.

The connection of Vitamin D and reduction of deaths from pneumonia was not made until 1920,"
1139,I asked my child when it would end and she said a silly-kid random number. I did the math. 4 yrs.
1140,"Price to pay for not pro-actively managing the human population. To reach the 1st billion, it took from the beginning of humanity till 1900. Since 1900, we added another 6 billion. Considering there a finite amount of resources (including air and water) and land, what makes you think there will not be any negative impact of continued population growth?"
1141,and you're also ignoring the fact that there is 3 different strains that have been identified of COVID-19 so yeah I don't even consider this video complete.
1142,"Statistics matter! Without treatment nor vaccine, we can expect 70% of the population to get covid19 in the upcoming years and based on the current dead rate which is nearly 8% we can expect 7 million people dead world wide. You can read the OMS article in regard the spanish flu and they used .3 factor over 70% percent to calculate the dead toll and they were right, we should now expect the same."
1143,"""We need to be carefull when and where we get our information"" ....fox news on background 😂 loved it"
1144,"The narrator has an annoying ""stall"" in the flow of his sentences, like he knows better. Good content but annoying narration."
1145,Let’s just hope this isn’t the original trilogy
1146,"It's the CCP's fault still, though."
1147,"Can we stop calling it the Spanish Flu but the American Flu as that is where it started. I Kansas specifically, then carried by newly recruited American soldiers to Europe."
1148,They had more sense than modern mankind. The didn't shut down the world.
1149,I've heard recently that they trace the Spanish Flu back to US military personnel in Kansas in 1916. Which means that it was running around for two almost three years before anybody ever recognized it. So it was running for five years not three years. They just spent the first couple of years on the battlefield where it wasn't identified until late.
1150,"That is a terrible thing.  Which it's interesting, but.."
1151,We are going to enter another wave because they are opening things up like beaches. Lord help us all.
1152,The Spanish flu was not even close to the BP. Stop sharing false numbers and facts. Thanks.
1153,100 years of scientific advancement is to reduce that that.
1154,Oh I’m sure you’ll make it last three years you in the media do you work hand in glove with China we know it you know we know it
1155,Who is going to be brave enough to take the Trump vaccine if they have it soon??
1156,Mass propaganda
1157,"in times of the black plague survivors of the plague were revered as saints were, and people would congregate around them, touching them and making contact that would allow the transfer of antibodies that resulted in the development of herd immunity. all of these earlier pandemics were stopped without big pharma or an immunologist. acquiring the antibodies of someone who has recovered is the key. natural remedies are the scourge of big pharma and the immunologists. the RNA vaccine is made of humanized mice with the human component coming from fetus and dead infant tissue. it will partially re write your genome and this is a fools errand to do for any reason. those who have failed at simpler tasks should not be trusted to tamper with us. flu vaccines with this same mouse DNA most likely made people more likely to aquire covid 19 , and the new vaccines will cause your cells to have animal characteristics that will leave you vulnerable to many more profitable ailments which once only animals could aquire. mankind has survived for centuries without big pharma and the immunologists, but may not live past them if we are not educated and proactive."

1160,how does the USA still not have free health care? facing illness and death as a human species is inevitable. i wish there could actually be a focus on TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE rather than strictly eliminating the virus alone. we are experiencing an unnecessary level of suffering that disproportionally punishes the poor and those with no loved ones/support. i'm not sure how much longer i can stand being on this planet tbh

The ""Spanish Flu"" was caused by a BACTERIA that was easily transmitted from person to person because of the deplorable living conditions and lack of hygiene in 1918.  The electron microscope had not been invented in 1918.  Nobody had any idea of what a VIRUS was in 1918."

1205,When there's something strange in your neighborhood. Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!
1206,Omg he used animal crossing for infrastructure.😂
1207,"and here we are, repeating history"
1208,The only thing we learn from history is that those in power do whatever they can to hold it.
1209,52 seconds and I’m already crying :/
1210,"take melatonin, up to 100mg a day
take vitamin c, up to 100 grams a day
divided doses, as needed, obviously"
1211,"So what is the ""one way""?"

1214,Outstanding presentation! More people need to see this video.

1216,Let us hope it goes on for another 8 yrs and then I can claim pension credit.
1217,2020: The end?
1218,"So, no conclusion as to the way to end it sooner?!"
1219,I’m not waiting 3 years
1220,"Latest study of successful treatment from France - 99% efficacy. 3,700 subjects. Incredible. It's not a pandemic if you don't want it to be."
1221,Wow everyone should watch this. Thanks for sharing
1222,The 1918 influenza started in the United States. The research in this is lacking.
1223,47k deaths... oh those days of the past.
1224,I just want to know what that is behind him floating @7:50?
1225,Nothing interesting here! Just bull.
1226,"Yeah let the Notre-Dame burn, it will not curse the world or something"
1227,Sounds about right.    I was thinking 2 with a vaccine
1228,Who can say whether it was a planned one also? (as news or as reality) 😏
1229,If you Google it it says the Spanish flu lasted March of 1918 to July 1919.
1230,Learn your lessons!
1231,Yaaaay quarantine for 2 more years
1232,The so called spanish flu started in Kansas
1233,REALLY COOL!!!!!!
1234,NOW WE KNOW WHERE TRUMP GOT HIS COVID 19  PLAN.
1235,We got tech now. I'm hopeful
1236,To end the pandemic - stop talking about
1237,We are in the verge of ww3
1238,This is not the 1918 pandemic!
1239,"stop calling it spanish, it came from the us"
1240,"Bruh that was 1918, this is 2020. Things have improved a lot since then. Testing, hospitals, technology has improved. No history is going to repeat over something from 102 years ago."
1241,"Now we’re at 498k deaths, 10x increase from 2months ago at this rate we’ll reach 4million deaths in the next 2 months"
1242,"I've seen several videos that purport to compare covid19 with the Spanish flu. But I've not seen any videos that compare Covid19 with polio, another deadly viral epidemic. What was the response to it? That pandemic lasted for decades. Why are we still here?"
1243,century old data may be complete but was it accurate?     Be careful when you make any sort of comparison between the two.  At least if you want it  to be accurate or meaningful
1244,"Swine flu lasted a year and a half, sir. Not no three. Lol"
1245,History teaches us about the future
1246,This name is completely undeserving
1247,Year 2020 trailer to Year 2030!
1248,and so we learned nothing
1249,Animal Crossing huh
1250,Okay I'm going to medical school
1251,"While playing a blame game may not be productive, covering the outbreak, obstructing other countries to learn and get to the bottom of this disaster is as foolish as how Chernobyl was handled."

1253,Barry as in Barrack??
1254,These videos go on & on & on & on & on & on & on & on & on & on  A long time to get to the point
1255,Gosh I hope we have better medical care after 98 years. One can only hope.
1256,Could be a military weapon from China... that got loose.
1257,It lasted 15 months atleast check resources
1258,"Factually incorrect if you call it the Spanish Flu

It did not start in Spain"
1259,3 years no way Jose.
1260,Can you please make a new one to reflect the current nightmare?
1261,COVID is a government hoax.
1262,"It’s interesting to note that the Democrats in 1918 pushed the opposite policies. While there was a real pandemic they fought to force  businesses to remain open. 

Now, when we do not have a real pandemic they are trying to close down businesses. Will future historians call this the Great Panicdemic of 2020?"
1263,"only one way..

vaccine perhaps?"
1264,"The cure to covid 19 is turn off the tv, throw away the mask, and stop drinking the koolaide"
1265,The virus is whole year round thers no end of virus  it's always there is a common virus

1271,"lol this needs an update 46k april 18 2020 127,000 june 27 2020 ...."
1272,Viruses can easily mutate because of how often and fast they replicate. SARS-Cov-id-19 could mutate into something that could become contractable via skin contact. Then no social distancing would work if we're not all wearing full hazmat body suits.
1273,I have no respect for these younh people 20 yr old at these protest they need to get job where are your parents. They should be ashamed of you.
1274,Somebody whit computer backgroung gave who 50 million tn say Pandemic. Guess Who
1275,"there is no comparison, just because it rained yestrday don't mean it rains today."
1276,Well..yes this is deeper though BG has become the mad evil Dr No but in the movie Dr No loses.  Because G is our new Lord & Master he decides our fate and we're powerless...have to submit to his machinations...Who knew the Class Nerd would be the biggest bully ...how ironic is that?
1277,"1 coach from my district tested positive, another 1 is a potential tested positive(no result yet) and now all the kids/parents they came in contact with had to be quarantine ....smh, one stupidity is leading to an unexpected result huh."
1278,"Case fatality rate. High.
Infection fatality rate. Lower.
Cases are just the ones we know about. But there are 'X' unreported cases the higher the number of unreported cases the less the fatality rate."
1279,Worldometer says otherwise on your CFR  stats.
1280,"I truly believe that Rife technology and Vitamin C IV Injection will cure the covid 19 virus, Google search Rife machine covid 19 virus Sharry Edwards...... If Facebook censors are reading this I mean for the treatment be done by licensed Doctors Not self treatment."
1281,"I love how he goes over previous pandemics but completely passed over the depopulation of the Americas, lol."
1282,And SARS2003 last a year
1283,"Interestingly they couldn't infect anyone with Spanish Flu ... think it was to do with installing electricity pylons ... 5G installation  and false reports about Iran who have no 5G ...it makes one wonder?

See Eric Dubay Covid 1984 and be scared."
1284,Dec2023? That would be four years duh... someone needs to learn to count
1285,Hello that was 1918 when they fought wars in trenched...it is 2020 TODAY you fight wars in a  A/C room with computers and BUTTONS...it is no longer Horse & Carriage it is NOW ...F1...
1286,CFR of 5% was way off fortunately
1287,Let’s hope not!
1288,The Chinese19 instead COVID-19
1289,Lol eleven point seventy five percent
1290,History always happens again and again and again............ b.j.Luvat
1291,To end COVID19 HUMANITY MUST WAKEUP...
1292,Are you talking to children?
1293,Thank god that COVID isn't THAT bad.
1294,This video didn’t age well. And it’s only been a couple of months.
1295,"Not sure if people back then also insisted on not wearing masks, reopening the country and had huge gatherings for protests and riots on the streets or rallies into the thousands indoors. If not, then this pandemic could get even worse than historic ones."
1296,Thanks
1297,I miss the late 80s😪😭😢😪
1298,Take enough vitamin D and you won't get very sick from Covid
1299,"If the media said all the viruses & bacteria we carry were a prob, they could cause mass sheepicide."
1300,Doc Greeny Azusano
1301,"yah, its not called the spanish flu because it originated in spain. the first cases were in fort riley Kansas on an American military base, if anything the etimology should be corrected. The 1918 epidemic known as the American influenza or the Kansas flu."
1302,Happy to hear your videos last message
1303,"Running scared and locking ourselves  out and away from the World will cure this Pandemic! That's what people  actually  believe,and that's what scares me!!"
1304,"We should be naming the 1918 pandemic as North American Flu, not Spanish Flu.... since is origin was in Kansas USA."
1305,I stand by worry kills more then the disease
1306,Where is he getting the cfr rate from?? Not accurate info...
1307,You won't see alot people like it's normal for awhile..
1308,The term INFLUENZA did not exist until 1931 !!!
1309,3 years of corona ugh
1310,"Dear lord, its as potent as a common cold, cdc etc downgraded it to basically just irritating march 12th 2020"
1311,Deja vu
1312,Cfr inaccurate.  Mislabeled cases and people dying from poor diagnosis and mislabeling deaths for body count money.
1313,Maybe test everyone sick or not sick and we can end this quick but too bad the test kits are not easy ! Wish just like the pregnant test 🤷🏻‍♀️
1314,Religious leaders have the real answer to beating covid-19 and they do nothing as usual. World Government leaders wanted this virus to spread and they got what they wanted. They never stopped the flights to and from China and now it's world wide! Wave 2 will happen after summer.
1315,Covid is a scare tactic
1316,"Welcome to my world, have raged against globalism, cruise ships, airlines, Disneyland, spectator  sports,
endless groups of people up each other butts.
Have sheltered in place for eight years and am loving it. I have an e-bike and a laptop and have settled into myself."
1317,Don't forget we have way more Idiots in 2020.
1318,Diseases is nature's  way of population  control.
1319,I DO NOT like PvP
1320,That's exactly what Trump has been doing. He is similarly scared   of this matter of Covid-19. And has done so out of unhelpful ignorance.
1321,"Sorry that was not a Coronavirus
That was influenza . Nothing faintly similar . Flu kills all ages . Covid19 90% are over 65 ."
1322,"The 1918 pandemic started in Kansas, USA. DEFINITELY DID NOT START IN SPAIN. USA is the grand-master of disease cultivation."
1323,even after 100 years of advancement.....we r unable to cure a type of disease that is even  more deadly than ever......it isnt actaully the advancement in health that could cure this flue....it is something else....may be after 100 or 200 years  it come back and we still  fail to stop it...turn to your God....he is the only creator of EVERYTHING...only he can end ...what he has sent to us.
1324,Actually it lasted 2yrs
1325,"Do us a favor and stay home. If you care, you will stay home."
1326,Comparing the Spanish flue with 50 million deaths with Covid19 with 250.000 deaths is fear mongering. Death rate of Covid19 is comparible with the flue.
1327,Meanwhile in Germany: „Let‘s open up all the stores again so we can have another outbreak“
1328,maybe im wrong cause i didnt watch the video yet but maybe its because in 1918 our medicine was less better than now? (if this was mentioned already sorry)
1329,How about the Sars ?
1330,"This is china virus , lab made china virus"
1331,"If many people with  comorbidity are counted as covid-19 deaths only, as  has been the case with SARS/CoV2, then the CFR will be falsely higher number?!"
1332,Welp this will probably last longer because people are protesting for hair cuts 😐
1333,"Having a crisis is a wonderful opportunity for power hungry people to consolidate their power and attack their enemies.  I am sure there are those who never want the current one to end.  I have noticed that the more liberal the governor or mayor, the more restrictions they are for.  Does Al Sharpton want racism to end?  Not if he stops benefiting from it.  Do the Palestinian leaders want peace between them and Israel?  Peace would be a disaster for them.  They would loose their positions and all their influence.  If all the money collected for the Palestinians were actually spent on the Palestinians the West Bank and Gaza would look like Beverly Hills or Pa;m Beach."
1334,"Lets be real, if china is an option for where the 'spanish flu' originated, its probably the right one."
1335,Wasn't the Spanish Flu renamed the Influenza of the 1918 so that it wouldn't cause discrimination against the Spanish (as happened with COVID-19 instead of the Chinese virus)?
1336,WEE WOO WEE WOO
1337,I asked in multiple sites.  Were there so many deaths that many graves were not identified?  Were deaths not recorded?  I’m doing family genealogy and a lot of family members disappeared around this time.  No record at all.
1338,"I'd like to point out that the death rate was actually about 21-22% when this video was made, as of today june 23 EST time hovering around 8-9%, you look at the amount of closed cases and divide the total amount of closed cases vs the deaths and you get your percentage."
1339,Must stop eating bat and pangolin.
1340,"The best thing we can do in any outbreak is to limit our contact with others and practice good hygiene


North Korea: G U N"
1341,46k deaths has risen to 156k+
1342,"We're all being lied to.
This was all planned.
Event 201"
1343,Don't worry China found the way how to end coronavirus
1344,"Spanish Flu we’re here and we’ll make trouble

Coronavirus we’re  now different but still make trouble"
1345,Can someone show this to our president?
1346,The people all died from Bacterial Pneumonia. It first began in Military Camp out West in the U.S. An experimental Bacterial Meningitis vaccine along with many other vaccines and serums were given before the men deployed.  The ones that became very ill at the camp were not sent overseas. The vaccine was cultured in horses. The families left behind when the soldiers went to Europe were cautioned to get the same Bacterial Meningitis vaccine and others. They were scared when told the men would return with many infections from Europe. Most became very ill over there from effects of their recent vaccines. Bacterial Pneumonia was the outcome for most.
1347,"Seems like the more advanced we think we are, the harder we fall."
1348,"I live in california and i don't know anyone that caught this virus,  none of my relatives know of anyone nor does my friends,  we hear it on the news a lot, that people are dying  in the hundreds of thousands but no one in the community know of anyone that's in the hospital , this might have been the common flu that was first going around   But those symptoms they talk about that's not a flu but something that cooks from the inside out, blood clots, brain aneurysm In a few area of the brain. Dry lungs hard to breathe.. Sounds like standing in front of a microwaves to me. I use to build micro waves i know enough not to stand in front of a microwaves while its on."
1349,"This is my take on this current pandemic. The death count of this Covid-19 is accountable for the amount of elderly we have now which is more than ever before because of better medicine and quicker access to hospitals, its not that big of a killer but its just hitting the right people in the worst way possible because a lot of these people live in retirement homes and one wrong move and the elderly could get sick. It might be possible that modern homes and cities are a possibility that people have a weaker immune system because people who don't live near mountains or a place with lots of dirt don't get the proper amount of bacteria that compared to people from 150 or so years ago who lived in log cabins in the woods surrounded by nature. My last take is that the news if fear mongering over the people to stay inside because lets face it, who has all the money? older people and these people don't wanna get sick so they influence the news to work in their favor(probably not true but its a neat theory). Just wash your hands and don't get close to shady looking people that might look sick."
1350,"You didn't really explain how to end the Covid-19 pandemic earlier !!!!!
Isolation alone.....forever......will lead to starvation."
1351,"the other factor is the infection rate. the other more deadly viruses have a lower infection rate.
with Covid it seems everyone gets infected even if it doesn't have much effect on most people it still hits a larger population.
like 30% of 100000 people is 30000 people where as 3% of 7 billlion is 210 million"
1352,You missed the solution that the news just moves on and we move on with our lives. It’s already playing out.
1353,"""we are all one community"" thinking like that is what got us infected in the first place and what is allowing greedy hotel owners to buy every house available for their tourism business leading many nationals to be without homes or without homes with decent conditions, making many houses extremely expensive to get. this globalistic nonsense is not even necessary in the first place, we already have our homes, our worlds, our countries and therefore in those countries we need to become a community."
1354,B
1355,"""We are all one community, and shifting blame does nothing to ourselves to the people we love. We just have to do our part.""
Finally, it is you who pointed out what the world really needs at this time other than never-ending shaming from countries to countries."
1356,"limit contact with others and practicing good hygiene is the best we can do? you sound like the news stations all around the world. how bout boosting your immune system? you should suggest people to take their vitamins like zinc, vitamin d and vitamin c. they can prevent or slow down the virus drastically. even drinking hot tea helps."
1357,"""...so we need to be careful about when and where we get our information"", while showing a picture of FoxNews.  Bias much?  How about showing eight different sources on a split screen?"
1358,cept trump and   rep  govs are opeing up too early
1359,future generations will look back at our response to covid-19 with laughter and shaking of their heads!
1360,Tuberculosis????
1361,"Please explain your ""logic"", here: 

8:16 & 8:27 'We cannot account for all of the deaths and cases, related to COVID-19. There are just too many cases for us to count, which are flying under the radar.'"
1362,"This was all to get President Trump out of office! Covid-19 
dies the minute it hits the sun !
So no 6 feet apart outside!"
1363,this dude really used animal crossing: new horizons as a source.
1364,"""-shifting blame does nothing to protect ourselves"" 
imagine being this shill for the CCP"
1365,"My cousin got the influenzas around January. Obviously, she needed to isolate herself and rest. But her mom told everyone she just got the flu and that I could play with her and that everything was fine. She could’ve infected me. I can’t believe people and how ignorant they could be."
1366,"Spanish flu - we sleep

Wuhan virus:"
1367,2020: The world became so soft people began fearing the flu
1368,2020s sucks
1369,"Humans are living closer than ever to wildlife as we infringe on habitat. This means that the potential for deadly zoonotic (originating from animals) diseases are all the more likely like Ebola and COVID-19. While denser cities mean easier spread of disease, expanding into the fringes will probably be far more deadly in the long term."
1370,Trump has not slept since lockdown.  Poor soul😂😂. America🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
1371,"Nostalgia for when only 46,000 people had died of COVID-19."
1372,"rather than avoidance...more often be proactive with use of essential oils!

Clove, Lemon, Cinnamon, Eucalyptus, and Rosemary oils are blended together into Thieves Oil...an ANTIVIRAL

1373,"The Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA.....I prefer to call it the Kansas Flu, cuz’ that’s where it originated! Kansas!"

1377,"Last time a horse lost in the Kentucky derby WWII started a kentucky derby horse lost last year and they're still arguing that because they just give it a shot i heard of corona before it was reported, they gave shots into the racing horses in 2000 than in 2015-2016 a bunch of race horses died racing from broken bones they said it was from ""muddy tracks"" and did not stop racing the horses they covered it up and are arguing that so yeah it started in horses from a shot look up ""Death of a Racehorse"" by W.C Heinz published by ""the Sun"" july 29 1949 2 pages tells you everything that im in America and im very disappointed and shamed to be an American our whole system is broken"

1381,Thanks for the virus China
1382,"2:37 they will look back at the U.S with disdain, but not any other countries"
1383,Incorrect the cov 19 is not as deadly and the regular flu is deadlier! Hospitals are calling broken legs cov 19 positive it's been proven period...
1384,"One way is the media, CDC and WHO to tell the truth because this virus is not as half as serious as the sars but numbers are being manipulated because politics"
1385,There are sadly still idiots that don't believe the government.
1386,"A big problem to consider with covid is that there is a lot of false data. The left wants this pandemic to look as bad as they can make it out to be. People who get shot or stabbed are recorded as dying from covid. I think hospitals are given $300,000 for every covid death they report. At one end it's follow the money, at another it's a trial run for socialism, and at another it's about controlling the population, and making Trump look bad."
1387,"IGNORANCE ON YOUR BEHALF, AND THE ARROGANCE OF GOVERMENTS, WILL BE OUR DOWNFALL... RESIST ONE WORLD ORDER... IT IS NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND!"
1388,I blame China
1389,Bull
1390,w
1391,"Taiwan was able to “prepare” for this pandemic by NOT listening to China’s claim that it wasn’t spread “person to person”. The world DIDN’T PREPARE because (except for Trump who banned travel on Jan 31), the rest of the world made the mistake of listening to China’s LAPDOG, W.H.O.
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS sided with Communist China against Trump’s travel ban."
1392,How to  eliminate this virus : Abolish the DEMON-CRAT party.
1393,only one way to end it and that is to end it.  three years won't be enough and neither will five.  This is nothing near the 1918 flu of my grandparents era. this is clearly about something else at this point.  do you want to venture a guess?

The underhanded attack on Fox News is so obvious."

1418,ah hello in 1918 they didnt have high tech testing or accurate numbers either so its all the same. using the numbers that we have today for covid 19 is accurate
1419,Great information! Thanks for uploading.

1436,"This is so ridiculous! Fear, fear and more fear! Boost you immune system fool."
1437,this already hasn't aged well
1438,WOW! I had no idea that Corona and 1918 had so much in common!
1439,if anything the covid19 death rate is higher since we have enormous amounts of testing going on and that effects the averages for coming up with death rates.
1440,And possibly Vitamin D Deficiency levels (which after the war in 1918 were probably pretty low) to modulate the immune system response. As we enter the summer and increasing UVB (nothing to do with the heat) will probably drop the rate until we get closer to the winter again (similar to the curve of 1918).
1441,"Wasn't the 2009 H1N1 outbreak just another outbreak of the Spanish Flu?
That Spanish Flu & H1N1 are the same virus?"
1442,God put an end to the virus  and they must get that vacine now I cant take this virus  and quarantine anymore make the corniaviris stop i bag you make the virus go away and disappear
1443,They didn’t have vaccines in 1918
1444,Ain’t nobody trying to deal wit this for 3 years

1452,"What was the purpose of this video ?   If we hug, everything will get better ?  Oh, and take a history class, or do a little research."
1453,"I saw another article on the  so called Spanish flu which stated it started in the USA in wet-markets.   IT DID NOT START IN THE trenches.  Perhaps we should change the name of this world wide epidemic, to American flu."
1454,I heard that the death of the younger people was from aspirin overuse. Something to do with Bayer & the patent ran out. I'll look into that again and post it.
1455,Jesse Morell Wuhan Lab book on hulu.. amazon banned it
1456,"no one closed nothing down back then, this is BS STORY"
1457,Very strange that viruses have upgraded their capacity  time to time and beacme more advance than our vaccine..
1458,What's with all the unrelated images?
1459,The difference between all the flu from the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus is that we cannot point out where most of the flu evolved but we know that this deadly virulent disease coronavirus came from Wuhan could possibly due to a leakage in a laboratory in Wuhan.
1460,"The opening story retold in New York, only in 2020."
1461,Yes of course..
1462,Is there really a pandemic?
1463,That was a whole lot of nothing...
1464,IT happened 102 years ago!!! Science has developed a little bit since then! You can't compare the two!
1465,My great pop had the Spanish flu in 1917 and died
1466,"U still didn’t officially mention the Only One Way to End COVID-19 Earlier, what is it?"
1467,The way to stop it is to put and end to the people that start it
1468,I know I ant the only on @t 9:24 that says fema
1469,Wonder what happens when government stop giving out 600 a week.
1470,Am thinking one man just eliminated covid-19  with his death by cop.
1471,I am so happy come to corona virus in this world why because every one make grow weapons and not focus health organization labs and scientists for humanity
1472,Well nothing has changed from what I can see
1473,"Before vaccines cancer was rare. That's why we blame it on the Sun.
Big Pharma is King!"
1474,"Industrial farm workers are a key risk for zoonotic infection as a result of their ‘routine and intensive exposure’ to the farm animals, potentially serving as a ‘bridge population’ that could transfer infections from animals to the wider public"
1475,That car is totally inaccurate
1476,I don't I got covid 19 middec. Yes our government lied to us this has been around for way more than a year and if you think Trump's gonna help us no he's not drs. Knew all along I almost died and six monthes later still can't breath righti feel like somethings not right with me but oh well nobody cares
1477,these are useless numbers. Depends on how may you test
1478,Spanish flu was caused by the radio waves introduced around the same time globally.  Virus's are created in the body and act like a solvent to clean up a toxic environment.
1479,"It just boggles my mind how, when we have so many diseases that emanate out of pig factory farms where we have such high human-animal interface, that we don’t just shut them down."
1480,"Get real or get educated! Needs to be updated! I do not have to do involuntary and domiciliary prison because there are irresponsible and ignorant people that they are not spending 20£ a year per capita in prevention, and they stopped doing healthy things for decades! Africa is doing well better than UK!"
1481,"Spanish flu, from Kansas USA. About time it gained its correct name, named for the pace of origin rather than for the country which named and investigated it."
1482,Very good history that i listen of.
1483,"Influenza still kills about 60,000 in the U.S. every year. The Spanish Flu is actually what we call Influenza today. COVID-19 is nothing like how bad the 1918 flu pandemic was."

1488,"BCG vaccine keep down the cases in the ex communist countries, where it was mandatory till this day."
1489,Best part was the wiggles distancing dance thing.
1490,Forgive me but I lost the solution you proposed
1491,No it lasted much longer than this.
1492,Probably because 5G is more powerful than radio waves.
1493,"the N95 masks , to properly work, must be smoke tested. They are then disposed of every two hours due to saturation. Anything short of these measures are nothing but mind games we play with ourselves to feel like we're doing good and being pro active. This is a monumental farce."
1494,wowow perhaps we need an update. Only 46K deaths beginning of April?  2 months later and its almost 10x that!! Still as many active (and perhaps you can double or triple that figure) as have recovered so perhaps you can double the amount of fatalities by July or August. .... and who said this is not as bad as the common flu!!??
1495,The 1918 Spanish flu wasn't a SARS virus. When the last person infected with the COVID -19 virus keeps it checked for 14 days (and infects nobody else) it is over...
1496,"Nothing new here, and a few things that shouldn't be."
1497,So far 0.0001% so far.  Ooohhh scary.
1498,What’s so bad is that many of us the symptoms are staying within us longer and longer as others get infected and we’re going to be seeing a lot more of this going around who knows how many years and it could get a lot worse than what it is right now and I have it
1499,"Fatality rate of Covid is between 0.1% -  0, 5%,"

1501,"In affect, Trump keeping the country in denial has made it as bad as the Gubvarmint in 1918 keeping quiet about it for war operational security. And/ or WMD in Iraq's case😱"
1502,How many people are there in lreand
1503,someone please send this to trump!!!!!
1504,FALSE FLOYD ATTACK !!!!!
1505,Their is no more more vivid 19 their only looting and riots not.
1506,"Your figures are off. And you think quarantine of the healthy is a good thing. Which makes this video, at best, irrelevant."
1507,We'll all be dead in 3 years if we don't get back to work.
1508,Spain remained neutral in the First World War and didn’t have the reporting censorship most other countries had. Their reporting of the Pandemic landed them with the name Spanish Flu. It actually came across to N.America with Chinese labourers. It had decimated Northern China in the Winter  of 1917/1918.
1509,The all world health care scientists fail and no one deep understand all so foolish scientists . The all world health scientists lab not power position now we know . No power country scientists intelligent all fool
1510,"1820-Pandemic

2020-ANOTHER PANDEMIC"
1511,"1918 is not 2020, completely different circumstances, what took 3 years to circumvate the globe then takes 3 weeks now. We have much better health care and standards of living are also miles in front of 1918."
1512,"But logically in 1918 the virus did not spred all over the world in the same speed,most of the people died before knowing the name of the viruses, now the story is different"
1513,Can't believe you didn't discuss the Hong Kong flu.
1514,death rate of covid 19 in north korea; 100%
1515,So how did it spread without having means of people traveling like today?
1516,End the pandemic and get that vacine going please
1517,"This isn't the flu (March) but it will act just like the Spanish Flu 1918 (Apr/May).  Ahh... Humanities majors quoting ""science"" they flunked in school. 

The Spanish Flu of 1918 was H1N1.  We had a H1N1 outbreak in 2009 with no attempt to separate people.   It went away in 2010.  Remember that WHO declared pandemic 11 years ago.   Most of us don't either,  and Obama waited 10 months after the first US case to declare any emergency. "
1518,"World Health Organization states that the greatest risk for zoonotic disease transmission occurs at the human-animal interface through direct or indirect human exposure to animals, their products (e.g. meat, milk, eggs...) and/or their environments."
1519,It only lasted 2 years and why does the calendar show December 2023 implying COVID will last 4 years.
1520,riots?
1521,Social distancing will be over by 2021 I guarantee it!!!
1522,"When you don’t want to take responsibility aka Donald Quack Ducktrump, blame China."
1523,Nobody expects the Spanish influenza
1524,And now the Florida state government has started to suppress the numbers.  Welcome to Murica.
1525,Covid 19 is not a pandemic it's a game...being played by some organization
1526,Very good!!!!
1527,"FROM GOOGLE>>High aspirin dosing levels used to treat patients during the 1918-1919 pandemic are now known to cause, in some cases, toxicity and a dangerous build up of fluid in the lungs, which may have contributed to the incidence and severity of symptoms, bacterial infections, and mortality. Additionally, autopsy reports from 1918 are consistent with what we know today about the dangers of aspirin toxicity, as well as the expected viral causes of death"
1528,There is only one way to end this pandemic. We all need to get microchipped with all cash being on the chip. It's the only way people.
1529,"Listeners should understand several things: (1) The ""Spanish Flu"" had nothing to do with Spain or influenza. The vast majority of people who died of this scourge died of pneumonia and a severe reaction that destroyed their ability to breathe. It originated at the American military post of Fort Ryley, Kansas. Experimental meningitis vaccine cultured in horses was developed by the Rockefeller Foundation and was a bacterial vaccine that was part of an experiment. The soldiers than were sent to Europe to fight, in very poor environmental conditions, from Kansas to the European front lines. How long has this type of biological warfare been available? For 100 years. Start reading, people. You're lives depend upon it."
1530,Interesting that the flu developed during World War I . So many advancements have taken place in technology  and medicine in the last century that I’m having a hard time believing this whole Covid 19 pandemic plannedemic...this was over 10O years ago!
1531,People that are making money off c v don’t want it to ever end. Wake up
1532,could always do ccp/communist style by executing all the infected
1533,"Pandemics are increasing in frequency, It’s not a random act of God. It’s caused by what we do to the environment  and what food we chose to eat. We need to start connecting that chain and say we need to do these things in a less risky way. Factory farming of animals is one such risky activity that we need to close down immediately."
1534,"The Spanish flu of 1918 had two unique contributing factors that pro-vaxers miss. 1. The populace had been (for the 1st time) massivly vaccinated (via military personnel) and with live germs & viruses. 2. Canned foods were massively used. These nutrient depleted foods caused severe nutritional deficiencies (like vit's A, C, D, E, Zinc etc)
   With the Spanish flu of 1918 unknown numbers were blamed on the flu when in fact had other causes (just like is being done today). So the number of 2nd wave infections/deaths was highly inflated "
1535,"History repeats it self , if anything literally wasnt such a deja vu and heard of only new facese different placese i would have been shocked a little .now it lasts pretty much the same period despite people in advanced time and there technology helps facilates matters but still the globe scientists keeps giving people failure vaccine lol i pet the didnt think it would be this hard to pick up the mess they coze  when they spreaded it to fullfile their 1 golden billion project . "
1536,Lpp
1537,"Forgive me, but I did not get your point."
1538,Slow down little
1539,?
1540,funny on how Trump acted the same way...
1541,"These are different times, we are not  in 2020 for nothing, medicine is different, hygiene, antibiotics, also they died (if you read about it) because they were given massive amounts of Aspirin and they bled to death, every virus has its history,  1918 was just after the 1st world war, many soldiers died upon their return, actually I was reading about it."
1542,"That is a nice story, but not true, the Spanish flue was called so because Spain did made it public, but it came up in a MILITARY BASE CAMP IN THE US. A US test for biological weapons ?"
1543,Trump wasn't on the ballot in 1918.This thing is over by November 3rd.
1544,Humans are a Virus to Planet Earth......it's all about perspective.
1545,And it all started this time with the Chinese Government not being truthful from the beginning.
1546,Sweden has to this day most death per 100.000 in the world. And only approx 7% has had the flu. The goal set by the goverment is heerd immunization which WHO say will never happen. Representitivs for NZ compairs the Swedish health organization chairman to a certain doctor during WW2 with first name Joseph other wants the goverment sent to the Hague for crimes against humanity due to the large amounts of death.
1547,ok cool
1548,not spanish at all...started in kentucky...and first seen in europe in france...what a joke
1549,I miss 1995
1550,Corona virus/sars2  is real.  People have to belive it is real.  Corona virus/sars2  gets stronger everyday.   It is a completely new virus and that's final.  It is not like a cold.  It is not like the flu.  It is a new virus and that's final.

1554,People are out rioting all across the USA during the Convid19 outbreak.
1555,"South Korea has an IFR over 1% minimum. Which would mean other countries would be higher..since South Korea population much healthier, and South Korea acted early and tested widely.  A bad flu year has an IFR of 0.02%  So you would be looking at COVID19 being about 100 times more fatal than a bad flu."
1556,Hydroxychloroquine
1557,"18. To Make The World A Better Place

Humans build homes to stay, while animals just live in caves, live in the open field or just dig mud and stay. We humans for making homes cut down trees of the forest and then build homes. By this trees are getting reduced. Nowadays many people do not have to eat. If humans too stopped building homes and live in the open forest, trees would grow everywhere and so many fruits would be in the trees. If this is done no living being humans or animals would starve, because at present when we cut trees, so many birds and many animals which eat the trees fruits and leaves have to find some another tree. We would have to build schools, colleges, hospitals, because without that we can't help ourselves. If there are no homes people could go anywhere, no need for two neighbouring countries to fight for land dispute at countries boundaries. At present what we are doing it is polluting the world and one day a major earthquake, tsunami, super volcano would come and many lives would be lost. So if we too lived in the open forest there will be no pollution, also our foods would be without chemicals. The very important thing no living being would starve."
1558,Get rid of all the cops and let Americans open carry again. We'll figure this covid thing out.
1559,We do still believe in demons.  They do still cause disease.  It's funny how flu season starts after Halloween.  The atmosphere in supermarkets at Halloween is nasty.
1560,"Two days ago a CDC report from California say's the death rate is between 0.03 and 0.05%. 
This isn't a pandemic. It's a scamdemic."
1561,"""Shifting blame does nothing to protect ourselves and our loved ones"" you say?? lol..umm...holding psychopaths responsible for their actions, especially when they run the freaking world however does do something to protect ourselves and our loved ones. so if any number of people are responsible for this, I sure want them to be held accountable! Call me crazy, sheeit.😲Am I the only one here??🧐peace and love to all.✌❤"

Im living in France and they are more concern about how is the economy than how is the peoples, they already are ok to open some tiny stores and planning to get kids to school in may so parents can work. Mask are missing and they are waiting test that will take about 6 weeks for ""chlorokin"", meanwille this thing had made his proof in a very big city and secoundary effects are low, they wanna wait 6 weeks making 50 000 possibl death"
1572,"Spanish Influenza has been called spanish flu for decades and i never of anyone having a problem with that, but saying Chinese Coronavirus is racist to chinese?"
1573,As of April 27th the fatality rate for Covid 19 is around the same rate as the seasonal flu.
1574,Well I met my stock footage quota for the year
1575,"The last sentence ""we dont need to blame any body"" seems in a good rhyme wt the flow of information. But, it is not objective as the virus is suspected by many experts to have originated from a lab in Wuhan and the outbreak was knowingly covered up by Xi Ji. Ping government. Xi Jin Ping n Tedros are the criminal of a super massive genocide."

1578,Herd immunity kicking in and it's slowing down naturally. 😄
1579,"Black Death was caused by a bacteria.  Today, antibiotics exist that could treat another bacterial pandemic.  Not true for viral diseases.  In a sense . . . today . . . it is hard to compare the two without at least acknowledging that difference.  AS noted by Etan below . . . a rhyme not a repeat."
1580,We destroyed the economy for something with a 99% recovery rate. Basically the government said we will protect you from this years seasonal flu and we stupidly let them.
1581,"8:06 : those figures are all wrong, because none of those countries are testing in mass, Italy for example only test the most vulnerable demographic, which means 65 yo+ and people with other diseases.
What you used to make those calculations isn't the total number of infected people, but the number of people who were tested positive, the difference is : only a specific part of the population is tested, therefore it doesn't represent the total number of people who have the disease."
1582,"In the meantime, the president of the White House tells people to revolt against their governor who started a quarantine.
Yeah, I know. Let's not bring politics in it."
